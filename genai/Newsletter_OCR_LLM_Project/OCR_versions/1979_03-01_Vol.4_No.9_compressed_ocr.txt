Second Annual CWAO Convention
Coalition Day in Washington
Monday, Jan. 29, 1979: Signs, buttons,
delegates... The day-long convention of the
Coalition of Women's Art Organizations
opened at the Embassy Row Hotel in Wash-
ington, DC. Upon registering, all delegates
(representing organizations or attending as
individuals) received a packet with the jam-
packed program for the day, political infor-
mation (how to talk to one's legislator, how
a bill becomes law), booklets on arts legisla-
tion and the status of women in art, a state-
ment of CWAO goals for the coming year,
and documentation of CWAO activities since
last January's convention.
CWAO president Joyce Aiken opened the
meeting promptly at 9 a.m., welcoming the
approximately 200 delegates who packed the
hall and formally introducing CWAO officers.
Speakers included Gail Rasmussen, executive
director, and Bella Schwartz, president, of
Artists' Equity Association, DC chapter.
Both stressed the need for artists to be in-
volved in government. (CWAO has been
working with Artists' Equity on such issues
as the Art Bank Bill.)
Next, representatives voted to accept a
position statement presented by Ruth Weis-
berg, CWAO Vice-President for Programs and
Goals. This included proposals for a federal
agency arts access directory, actions in art
education against the monopoly of Janson
and Gardner textbooks, and formation of a
national network to influence legislation
directly.
Then, evoking the spirit of Houston,
La Verne M. Love, Women's Coordinator,
Smithsonian Institution, asked us to join
hands in a prayer for sisterhood. Love stress-
ed the importance of reaching out to include
more minority women.
Ellouise Schoettler, CWAO Executive Di-
rector, presented a legislative report referring,
among other things, to the vicissitudes of the
White House Conference on the Arts, which
may now be held in 1980 if funds are appro-
priated. A spirited discussion followed her
reading of a resolution in support of the Art
Bank Bill, raising the issues of equitable rep-
resentation for women and minorities, as
well as the need for contracts to protect the
rights of artists whose works might be pur-
chased. As currently written, the legislation
includes a deaccession policy that has upset
many artists. The resolution was tabled for
further discussion.
Proceeding promptly in the crowded
agenda, Louise Weiner from the Dept. of
Commerce discussed a time-motion study
on culture being conducted by her depart-
ment. She spoke also of ways Commerce can
work with artists' groups for mutual goals.
Next was Judith Brodsky, who, with a
stirring tribute to his accomplishments, intro-
duced one of the key speakers of the morn-
ing, Senator Harrison A. Williams of her
home state of New Jersey. Williams has been
an active supporter of the arts in Congress
for 20 years and is a sponsor of the Art Bank
Bill. He emphasized that we as artists must
communicate ideas not only through our
works, but with our voices to the legislature.
He spoke glowingly of the potential of the
Art Bank-both for those who produce art
and those who will be inspired by art in the
workplace.

Closing the morning program, Mayor Mari-
on Barry of the District of Columbia de-
page 2/ WAN/ March 1979
scribed his plans to incorporate art into city
agencies. These include rotating exhibits by
local artists in the mayor's office and setting
up an arts advisory board. According to
Mayor Barry, "We gauge our cities by their
art and artists," and these are often key
tourist attractions.
Adjourning to the Rayburn House Office
Building on Capitol Hill, delegates lunched
with women working in the State Depart-
ment and in other Washington institutions.
Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), who might be de-
scribed as a "converted feminist" on art is-
sues, read the depressing statistics he had pre-
sented to a congressional committee, which
detailed the minuscule representation of
women on grant panels and in national col-
lections. (Women at my table from the per-
sonnel of the department National Gallery of
Art removed their identity badges in embar-
rassment at these statistics.)
The floor was then taken by June Wayne,
our eloquent principal speaker. She came to
Washington first in 1939 to protest dismiss-
als of artists from the WPA project. Describ-
ing the success of that initial artists' contin-
gent, Wayne reiterated the need for adequate
statistics on the number of women in public
collections, noting that all museums receive
public funds. She discussed other issues, in-
cluding the inequity of tax laws for artists,
the limited number of grants given to women
artists, and her ambivalence about the Art
Bank Bill (deaccession being her major ob-
jection). Inspired by this message, delegates
then went to plead the case of women artists
directly with their legislators. For many it
was a first experience of political lobbying.
At a debriefing meeting and wine-and-
cheese party later, participants were general-
ly enthusiastic about their afternoon. Most
had been able to speak directly with mem-
bers of Congress or their staffs. The flush of
excitement was on the faces of all I spoke
with, and they were optimistic about our
issues. (On a more realistic note, I am sure
that our initial contact in Washington is only
the beginning of many such actions.)
In conclusion: It was an impressive day
of hard work, well planned. My only regret
is that more artists could not afford the trip,
and I hope that future CWAO national
events can be organized to include the voices
of more artists.
Other notes: On Tuesday, at the panel
"Folk Art and Neo-Folk Art," Pat Ferrero
showed slides of a former art instructor of
mine, Grace Earl, from Carnegie-Mellon U.,
my special favorite during her one brief sem-

ester. I had so few women instructors in my
university days that I was delighted to find
Earl once again. She lives now in a small
apartment in San Francisco, where she cre-
ates fantastic quilts.
The ceremony for "Outstanding Achieve-
ment in the Visual Arts" brought tears to
my eyes as I watched my dear friend and
mentor Isabel Bishop receive an award. Along
with most others in the room, I was over-
whelmed by the presence of these distin-
guished women, each with her own person-
ality Louise Nevelson with inch-long eye-
lashes; Alice Neel, crying from the lights or
the moment; the formidable Selma Burke.
(O'Keeffe sent a brief telegram.) I loved see-
ing each artist being herself and presenting
yet another perspective as role model. At the
exhibition of the artists' work that opened
at the Middendorf Lane gallery after the cere-
mony, numbers of women-some shy, some
bold couldn't resist asking for an autograph
or to have their picture taken with one of the
artists. Isabel Bishop found herself placed in
front of her portrait by Alice Neel and was
surrounded by admirers.
At Wednesday's "Performance and Events"
panel, I was especially impressed by Suzanne
Lacy's frank discussion of use of the media.
This was the first time I had heard an artist
describe publicly how she had organized an
event so that no matter how it was picked up
by media her message (in this case, on rape)
would get through. More artists should talk
about how they gain publicity for shows
and events.
During the week I met women I had
known only by name or through correspon-
dence; others were old friends from a year
ago. Home now, tired, back at school and
studio, I think of next year. WCA says it may
take art and politics to New Orleans.

Decoration Day
at ArtistsTalkOnArt
"If there's anything I'm certain of at this
moment, it's that ornament and decora-
tion have become dead arts in the west."
Clement Greenberg, Art International,
January 1975
That quotation, batting around in my files
for four years, came to mind on the auspici-
ous occasion of "Decoration Day" in Soho
last month. Whether Greenberg was thinking
primarily of something like the squiggles
stamped by General Electric onto refrigera-
tor doors to "ornament" or "decorate'
them, or whether he had the fine arts sector
in mind, is not clear. Either way, he should
have read his Wölfflin. In Principles of Art
History (1932) Wölfflin said, "The history
of art is not secondarily but absolutely pri-
marily a history of decoration."
For Greenberg, and anyone else who may
have missed it, here's a rundown on the first
of two recent panels about modern art that
declares itself, first and foremost, decoration:
'Interior (and Exterior) Decoration'
ATOA panel, Jan. 26
Robert Jensen, mod.; Valerie Jaudon, Ned Smyth,
Robert Kushner, Joyce Kozloff, Scott Burton,
Miriam Schapiro, Arlene Slavin, speakers.
There was an air of Old Home Week at the
"Interior (and Exterior) Decoration" panel
Jan. 26. When a man in the audience called
out to Joyce Kozloff, "Louder-we can't
hear you!" everyone laughed, because they
knew it was her husband Max. Miriam Scha-
piro's husband, Paul Brach, also made some
fine points from the sidelines, including the
fact that in ancient Greece the artist who
carved the capital of a column received exact-
ly the same wage as the one who "sculpted"
the figures in the pediment.
The program opened with slides: each
panelist whipped through a set of wonders
that ranged from the Piazza Italia in New
Orleans, designed by Charles Moore, and the
Dag Hammarskjold Plaza fantasy in concrete,
"Five Arcades," by panelist Ned Smyth, to
Miriam Schapiro's collages-of-kimono shown
side by side with the antique kimonos that
inspired them. (Schapiro noted later that art-
ists have always used resources-"their stu-
dios are filled with reference materials"-but
in the recent past have been skittish about
owning up to it.)
I say the artists "whipped through" their
slides because with eight speakers one might
have expected the show to drag a bit, as it
can when hungry artists bask too long in the
spotlight. But, perhaps bullied by their lead-
ers, or perhaps because each of them has had

considerable recognition already, the panel-
ists proceeded smartly, even a bit too smart-
ly. I would have liked a little lingering-to
ply the secrets of Miriam's intense kimonos,
for instance, or the underglaze magic of
Joyce Kozloff's tile wall constructions.
Scott Burton, an anomaly in this context,
earned his place with a concise review of as-
pects of the history of furniture as decora-
tion, and earned forever a place in my heart
by describing the pink, light blue, and yellow
painted on sections of his child's furniture
as "babied-out" versions of the primaries.
Discussion after the slides was desultory,
picking up only mildly when one would-be

tions, art. Original, detailed, well illustrated, it also
contains a complete listing of stores and museums

Young Turk declared from the floor that
decoration lacks "confrontation." (His own
work is, he allowed, based on the sundial.)
Joyce ended this confrontation by sweetly
but firmly explaining that their premise is
decoration for its own sake. The absence of
further confrontation may have been due to
current general acceptance-even ascendance
-of the art. In fact, pattern painting, a major
form of the new decoration, has recently
been declared by the popular press to be not
only "the rage of Europe," but "the most
vital" current style!
In the audience were other non-confron-
ters, including Mimi Weisbord, who has sur-
vived a move to Soho and gotten a CAPS
grant for her book; Yale Epstein, who estab-
lished a WAN first by liking his picture with
the WAN writeup of his panel; Judith Solod-
kin, now of new large Solo Press premises at
461 Park Ave. South; a phalanx of Heresies
women, particularly from the Women's Tra-
ditional Arts issue on which both Schapiro
and Kozloff worked; a flock of regulars;
ghosts of panels past; and probably just plain
decoration groupies like myself-some of
whom may also have been at the first ATOA
panel on pattern painting moderated by Peter
Frank at the Open Mind on Greene Street,
Feb. 7, 1975 (perhaps the first "public" ap-
pearance of the topic up from the under-
ground, one month after Greenberg's cer-
tainty).
When they dipped the gallery lights, then
threatened to eject us forcibly, small compa-
nies began to peel off in search of bars to
continue the reunion. But when set upon by
jukeboxes, strolling minstrels, or other anti-
conversation devices of management, I cede
the field immediately. I mean I went right
home.

Note: The next ATOA panel, Feb. 2, was "Sources
of Patterning and Decoration," with Carrie Rickey,
moderator, and Brad Davis, Richard Kalina, Robin
Lehrer, Tony Robbin, and Barbara Zucker, speakers.

Duncan Replies
In "When is a Panel Not a Panel?" (Jan.
WAN) Donna Marxer reported on the Nov.
18 panel on communication between artists
and writers on art. Carol Duncan: "Criticism
is... the invisible power that converts poten-
tial art into the real thing... channels art
into a thin trickle, which works pretty well."
Marxer: "No one groaned... when [Duncan]
said flatly that there is no conspiracy in the
art world." Here, Duncan elaborates on her
intended meaning.
Marxer quoted correctly from the paper
I read but didn't quite get my meaning. I did
say that there is no "conspiracy" in the art
market. As I then tried to explain, I meant
that few people in the art world will admit
to being party to any art market conspiracy.
Even "important" trend-setting dealers and
critics can claim that they are exercising
their individual free choice and basing their
decisions on judgments of "quality." They
really believe that and do not experience
themselves as acting in some kind of conspir-
acy. My point is, the "conspiracy" is usually
not conscious. It has its roots in the social
relations of our society and in the seemingly
innocent values we internalize and act upon.
The conditions that so many artists find op-
pressive are reinforced by the aspirations and
beliefs of the artists themselves. It is useless
to get angry at critics, who are not as power-
ful as artists imagine. We must understand
how our own values and beliefs about art
contribute to our own oppression. ■
LETTER TO EDITOR
In the Nov. WAN... a CETA artist wrote to cor-
rect an error of fact in your Summer 1978 article
"CETA Artists at Work." She was not on welfare,
as had been stated, but on unemployment insur-
ance "the latter [as opposed to welfare] having
been earned." Contained within her correction and
statement are some hidden value judgments, which
should be addressed.
Since public assistance, or welfare, is paid out
of monies collected in federal and state taxes, we

Skowhegan Summer
The directors of Skowhegan summer
school of the arts tell us that this year their
painting faculty will be largely women-a
point of special interest because faculty are
"elected" by students.
Frances Barth, Agnes Denes, Lois Dodd,
and Susan Shatter are listed as painting resi-
dent faculty. Chuck Close, Elaine de Koon-
ing, and Nancy Graves will be painting visit-
ing artists. Other faculty include Louise Bour-
geois in sculpture and Lucy Lippard as Wil-
lard W. Cummings Lecturer.
The nine-week session on 160 acres in
central Maine offers painting, sculpture,
drawing, and fresco. Tuition and board cost
$1,950. More info from Skowhegan, 329

Marxist Caucus at CAA
Marxist Approaches to Art History'
Panel, Caucus for Marxism & Art, Feb. 1
Eunice Lipton, Carol Duncan, moderators; David
Kunzle, Ken Lawrence, Gary Tartakov, Josephine
Gear, Adrian Rifkin, speakers.
It's no news that art history is generally
taught in a context apart from, or above, his-
tory-as though artists, by the nature of their
work, have no social responsibility. At this
year's CAA convention, the Caucus for
Marxism and Art presented an alternative to
this general situation and to the convention
itself with the panel "Marxist Approaches
to Art History."
Eunice Lipton, opening the session, noted
the presence of three British speakers out of
the five panelists. The first three papers dealt
with the connection of art to imperialism;
the other two were specific subjects seen
from a Marxist perspective.
David Kunzle discussed the role of art in
Chile during the Allende regime and under
the current military dictatorship, seeing art
as a part of, not a response to, social change.
At first, he said, murals and posters avoided
confrontation with the enemy, later grew
less passive. Since the coup in '73 and the
concurrent attempts at destruction of popu-
lar, political art, new forms of underground
art have appeared. For example, arpilleras,
fabric wall hangings made by Chilean women.
Like the quilts of early American women,
they involve individual origin and collective
production. Many of the arpilleras contain
explicitly political messages; some are less
overt and some are simply beautiful. (Both
slides and actual examples were shown.)
Women are able to earn money through the
sale of this work, frequently supporting fami-
lies splintered by the junta. Pinochet's govern-
ment finds this and other art with a similar
perspective threatening, and has tried, unsuc-
cessfully, to co-opt the arpillera movement.
Ken Lawrence provided a refreshing
break from the recent deluge of Tut-dom.
Showing how the African-ness, the Egyptian-
ness of the Boy King has been distorted, the
conflicts of that period of history de-empha-
sized, Lawrence discussed the way art is used
by imperialism because it's "not political."
Gary Tartakov defined exotica as what is
"incomprehensible and irrational to us." The
title of his talk was "Exoticism and the Im-
perialist Vision of 19th-Century European
Photography of India." Showing some of
these photographs in slides, he demonstrated
the way that subjects viewed out of context
can give an entirely false view of a country
and its people. For example, the familiar im-
age of a man lying on a bed of nails conjures
up visions of asceticism, pain, and strange-
ness. Actually, this is a painless, safe religious
act done for money by the very poor-at the
bottom of the photo, generally cropped, is
the receptacle into which to throw coins.
Josephine Gear's topic was "The Cult of
the Baby in 19th-Century Art." Using extra-
ordinary slides of British art, all containing
two figures (mother and child), she spoke
about baby worship and its relationship to
the conditions of the time. The creation of
nuclear families brought about upheavals in
male-female relationships amounting to "the
husband producing labor, the wife producing
love." Along with this came an idealization
of motherhood and, as a result, of babies.
The repressed sexuality of the time was also
page 8/WAN/March 1979
expressed in the strong eroticism of some of
the work (this relationship apparently having
been the only acceptable place for women's
sexuality). Other paintings reflected moods
ranging from adulation to fun. In this con-
text, the discussion of women's rights in Eng-
land became especially meaningful.
Adrian Rifkin, speaking about the cultural
context of the Paris Commune, showed an-
other collection of beautiful slides. Most of
these were of cartoons demonstrating the for-
mation of class alliances within the political
struggle. The degree of physical violence de-
picted in these cartoons-on both sides-was
high. The women's movement was seen as
the most socialist of the left at that time.
In the question-and-answer period, there
was some discussion about the Caucus and its
work within the CAA. In a brief exchange,
Carol Duncan politely refused to agree with
CAA representative Beatrice Farwell that the
CAA is a democratic organization. Gary Tar-
takov characterized the difference in objec-
tives as "kings and queens, not Queens and
Bronx."

Artists and Community
in the Context of Social Change'
Panel, Caucus for Marxism & Art, Feb. 2
Martha Rosler, Alan Sekula, moderators; Mel
Rosenthal, Suzanne Lacey, Fred Lonidier,
speakers.
The second meeting of the Caucus for
Marxism and Art at the CAA convention was
a step out of art history and into making art
today-specifically, making art that effects
social change. Because the Caucus had been
granted a very brief time slot, only three art-
ists were scheduled to speak, each to discuss
her/his work in the context of social change.
Martha Rosler, in her introduction, noted
that each artist was dealing with violence:
physical violence or social violence. Later,
she tied this to the responsibility of political
artists to gain control of language, to move
away from the media definition of "violence."
Photographer Mel Rosenthal described his
discomfort with audiences that skim over the
political content of his photographs, respond-
ing only to the form of the work. In his pho-
tographs of the South Bronx, Rosenthal has
insisted not only on the political meaning of
the subject, but on the relationship between
the art and the subject-the people of the
area. His original idea was to make portraits
of everyone living on the street where he
works at a health center. It became apparent
that many of these people had never seen
accurate photos of themselves; in the course
with them through his work. The photo-
of a year, Rosenthal became very involved
graphs show the subjects as very real people-
in very real poverty-not just another burned-
out-South-Bronx photo in the media.
Suzanne Lacey presented much of the ma-
terial she'd covered in a previous panel on
performance and environmental art from a
somewhat different perspective. She and Les-
lie Labowitz co-founded Ariadne to work
against violence against women. Discussing
several projects on rape, murder, and violence
in the record industry, Lacey explained her
use of the media. This entails not only get-
ting the personal cooperation of local govern-
ment officials and journalists, but actually
setting up performances and exhibits to ac-
commodate the media. Underlying this is
Ariadne's analysis of the role played by
media in preventing or allowing political
change.
Fred Lonidier spoke about reaching a
labor-union audience. Believing that the
whole structure of the workplace must be
changed to affect occupational health prob-
lems in a major way, Lonidier created a pho-
to exhibit. He took photographs of the re-
sults of work-caused diseases and added a
text about the historical context of these
diseases and injuries within the work situa-
tion. The exhibit did attract many union
members. At the panel, he spoke of the diffi-
culties of reaching such "non-art" audiences.

When our time in the Lincoln Room ran
out (we were reminded of this by another
CAA rep), we were left hanging in mid-dis-
cussion. Then it was discovered that another
spot was, unofficially, available. Perhaps 40
of us sat in a circle there and continued to
talk and talk about the role the media play
for the political artist, about the difference
between (performance) art and political activ-
ism (is Phyllis Schlafly a performance artist?),
about political art as a process of self-identifi-
cation (for example, the exhibit of shopping-
bag ladies' art at the Met, organized by Anne
Marie Rousseau), about definitions of "cul-
tural worker." -Leslie Satin

An Evening with
Paula Modersohn-Becker
AIR Monday Night Programs since 1973
have ranged from male critics discussing
women's art to a Heresies open meeting. The
biggest audience of the year-more than 50
people-turned up November 20 to hear art
historian Diane Radycki read from her recent-
ly completed Letters of Paula Modersohn-
Becker. The volume includes translations
from the German of selected letters and jour-
nal entries by Becker, plus chapter introduc-
tions and annotations supplying the artistic
and feminist contexts of the period.
To date Paula Becker (1876-1907), a
painter long acclaimed in Europe, has been
virtually unknown in this country. But there
has recently been an awakening of interest
about her life, work, and times.
Becker, like her husband, Otto Moder-
sohn, was a member of the Worpswede art-
ists' colony, near Bremen, Germany. A 15-
minute color film opening the reading gave
an idea of the village and the surrounding
moors as they were at the turn of the cen-
tury, as well as a survey of Becker's art. (The
movie was rented for the evening by AIR;
artist Cathey Billian provided the projector.)
During October and November, Becker's
work was being shown at La Boetie Gallery,
in an exhibition entitled "Three German Art-
ists' Colonies: 1890-1914: Worpswede, Mor-
itzburg, Murnau." Had she lived longer,
Becker might not be remembered as a Worps-
wede artist, for from the start her work dif-
fered radically from that of the colony's
other artists.
The new interest in Becker, it seems, is in
her person and experience as well as her art.
Adrienne Rich's recent book, The Dream of
a Common Language, contains a poem, "Let-
ter from Paula Becker to Clara Westhoff"
(Becker's closest friend, a sculptor and wife
of Rainer Maria Rilke). This "letter" from
one woman artist to another explores issues
and feelings, gathered from Becker's writings,
that are stunningly moving and contempo-
rary.
In 1906, Becker left Worpswede and her
husband and stepdaughter to paint in Paris;
Radycki's reading focused on this year in
France.
"I couldn't stand it any longer and I'll
probably never be able to stand it again,
either. It was all too confining for me and
not what-and always less of what-I needed."
Radycki writes: "It was marriage and the
provincialism of Worpswede; . . . it was not
being taken seriously by anyone but a dear
man whose art took no risks; . . . it was out-
BOOK REVIEW
Plain and Fancy: (American Women and Their
Needlework, 1700-1850). Susan Burrows Swan.
New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977. 42
color photos, 123 b&w photos. $14.95 (cloth).
Plain and Fancy is a very important book. It's an
intelligent and informative piece of needlework his-
tory as well as a source of women's history, weav-
ing the threads of needlework with the course of
history. We have all read about Elizabeth (Betsy)
Ross and Martha Washington and their needlework;
we've also seen a lot about costume and fashion
history. But Swan is concerned with wider events.
She traces the development of needlework from
1700 to 1850, as well as the lifestyles and social
and economic and political pressures on women
during these times. The reader realizes that needle-
workers have never created in isolation, but have
always been formed by the outside world.
The book begins with a description of the diffi-
cult lives of our foremothers, their lack of materials,
their confined lifestyles. We see the indenture form
filed for Sarah Wade in 1826, a contract that
Paula Modersohn-Becker Self-Portrait, 1906
growing heavy skies and artistic moralism; it
was turning 30; it was frustration and it was
ambition."
Among the all-too-familiar, recurrent
themes-financial problems, familial pressure
-there emerges a picture of this young artist,
her conflicts, her defiance of guilt, and her
passion: "I'm getting there. I'm working tre-
mendously...I am going to be something-
I'm living the most intensely happy period of
my life. Pray for me. Send me 60 francs for
models' fees. Thanks. Never lose faith in me."
But as the year went on, the pressure
from husband, family, and friends mounted,
until in November 1906, Becker allowed her
husband to visit her in Paris.
"By March she was pregnant, by May they
were back in Worpswede, in November she
was dead."
Radycki ended her. reading with "Letter
from Paula Becker to Clara Westhoff," Rich
herself being unable to attend. During a
question-and-answer period, Helen Serger
from La Boetie Gallery spoke from the floor
about Becker's surviving family. Interest was
high and discussion continued informally.
The impact of the evening on many could
be summed up in the words of sculptor Erica
Rothenberg:
"I had never heard of this artist. I walked
into the reading one woman and I'm walking
out another. To hear elucidated so vividly
and passionately so much of her identity, so
many of her struggles... gave me a sense of
history and tradition, the knowledge that the
things I face today, someone faced 70 years
ago. These were the struggles of an artist of
genius." -Jennifer Arndt
forced her to work for a family in exchange for
certain "education" and a hope chest of sorts.
While the woman was assigned to the home, to
spinning, darning, marking linens, cleaning, cook-
ing, and raising children, the men ventured out to
pursue business affairs. Women in isolated areas
created their own art forms from this isolation,
such as the Deerfield embroideries.
During the 18th century, samplers were very
popular. In the many boarding schools opened to
accommodate young girls, little was taught about
"intellectual subjects," but needlework, music, and
art were emphasized. In this, Swan points out, the
girls were taught to be docile and demure. They
were being prepared not to be independent and
self-supporting, but to be charming and dainty.
At the same time, they were prepared for the poor
health and widespread diseases of the times. Most
sampler verses are very depressing. In time, schools
changed (thanks to some independent-minded wom-
en) and eventually needlework disappeared from
the curriculum.
In Chapter 3, "The Golden Years of Needle-
work," Swan paints a wonderful portrait of life in
Neel & Stein at WCA-NY
Alice Neel and Judith Stein spoke at the
January 21 meeting of the New York chap-
ter of the Women's Caucus for Art, an even-
ing in the chapter's ongoing program series.
More than 50 members came to Wendy
Meng's studio for the discussion, which fo-
cused on Philadelphia's Moore College of
Art, the first women's art school in the
United States.
Art historian Stein's research into the his-
tory of the college, established in 1848 as the
Philadelphia School of Design for Women,
brought to light 19th-century attitudes to-
ward art and the female sex. Since women,
considered especially well suited for pains-
taking work, could practice the arts at home,
their work as designers would neither con-
flict with domestic tasks nor bring them into
open competition with men. Neither would
it expose them (heaven forbid) to sexual
temptations through contact with males on
the job. In fairness, Stein pointed out, the
founders genuinely desired to provide needy
women with professional training, and also
believed that exposure to art would improve
character.
It was the energetic, compassionate Sarah
Peter who initiated the effort to found a
school of industrial art. Early students prac-
ticed drawing, textile design, lithography.
wood engraving, and other practical subjects.
By 1921, when Alice Neel enrolled as an illus-
tration student, the school's name had been
changed and fine arts added to the curricu-
lum. Neel, the school's most famous alumna.
confessed that she chose a woman's college
in part to be able to concentrate on her work
without male distraction. Her lively and wit-
ty reminiscences were interspersed with seri-
ous advice to young artists ("Train your
memory!").
The problem was, scarcely any art stu-
dents were present at the meeting. A discus-
sion of the discrimination that many women
students still encounter would have given per-
spective to the historical background of wom-
en's art education. For example, consider the
devastating account by Patt Likos (Feminist
Art Journal, Fall 1975) of the pressures she
experienced as a student at Moore College.
We need to research women's history in
art, to honor and learn from venerable wom-
en artists. But we must encourage today's
students to speak out and we must heed their
testimony if art education is to contribute to
equality of opportunity for all artists.

the home. It becomes clear why furniture was so
important, why women worked so hard to em-
broider chair covers and bed curtains. The home
was the center of all entertaining. A discussion of
the early feminist movement includes the first
women's rights convention in 1848 at Seneca Falls,
and stories of Mary Wollstonecraft and other wom-
en who fought for the right to be independent after
their husbands died. (At the time, Swan explains,
married women were permitted by law to own vir-
tually nothing.) The reader sees the effects of the
Industrial Revolution on needleworkers, the effects
of new leisure time and of better education for
women.
I loved every minute of Plain and Fancy. I rec-
ommend it to needleworkers, feminists, and the
male chauvinist who lives down the block.

Texas Letters-Part Two
Another letter from Jeanette Feldman
continues the story begun in last month's
WAN She writes here about recognition,
choosing between art and crafts, moving on
in her work, coming to terms with Texas...
July 18, 1978
I'm glad you liked the material. I was
afraid you might be expecting something
heavier, about WOMEN struggling together
against the art establishment, issuing mani-
festos right and left-instead of our very sim-
ple, selfish reasons for organizing....
In answer to your question, the "Chisos"
piece is one of 12 fiber works based on a
three-day trip we took several years ago. We
began at Big Bend Park in the Chihuahuan
Desert of southwest Texas; the Chisos moun-
tains and Basin are in this unique, wild, erod-
ed area. Then we traveled from Presidio (the
asshole of Texas and always the hottest spot
in this terribly hot state) to Mexico. The
train started at 4 p.m. and went through the
desert as the sun was setting. I was mesmer-
ized by the shadows in the buttes and the
purplish, grey and brown landscape. The
next morning we took a train through the
Sierras (shades of John Huston and Humph-
rey Bogart) across Mexico to Los Mochis;
then a train home. The object of the trip was
the trip. Indian culture, Spanish culture, and
the power of nature just exploded in my
head. I began working with shapes from the
desert and Indian and Mayan-Aztec forms
infiltrated...
The flag variations are patchwork with
machine and hand stitchery and applique, all
in regular home sewing fabrics, nothing fan-
cy or unique. "Hope" has stars and letters in
silver stretch dress fabric. I can't afford fan-
cy fabrics and I like the challenge of modify-
ing materials to suit my needs. For instance,
I used semi-sheer fabric with dark machine
stitching over a different color cloth to get
just the exact red I needed-a fiber "glaze"
like glazing in oils. Some of the flags are in
Regina Bartley's book on machine stitchery.
... I showed the flags in October '76 at
Mind's Eye, a gallery in the Montrose area
here, which shows craft media as well as
"fine" arts. But I've always minded the craft
category for myself. The search for mastery
of technique and material is all very well and
important, but I missed the involvement with
currents of contemporary art-making. Finally
I withdrew from local craft groups and the
American Crafts Council, and resumed paint-
ing and drawing along with the fiber work-
a felicitous decision.
I had started in fibers ten years ago, begin-
ning with traditional crewel stitches. Gradu-
ally I got into all aspects of fiber (except
weaving-warping the loom was my Water-
loo) and every possible technique-stitching
over dye-painted areas, beading, applique
(my favorite), patchwork, working in fabric
with beads, sequins, and wonderful threads
was a sensuous delight. I made all kinds of
feelies with fur and feathers, suede and lace.
Then I felt I'd mastered the medium-fiber
became another technique, not the only one.
I added drawing and painting again, and a
kind of funky wood sculpture and surrealism
... Your last question is the hardest-
about my life today. I'm 48 years old and as
an artist always just beginning, starting again.
Every new piece seems to be the first-a new
learning process. I had assumed these would
be my harvest years, instead of always seed-

"Chisos" by Jeanette
Feldman. "Handsewn
and stuffed... beige
brown and black felt
with loose threads of
fine wool and little
brass washers and
thingies added. I see
it as a kind of papoose
carrier to hang in an
Indian chief's long-
house."
I'm still married to Norm, 23 years, and
still like him. Ann, 15, and Henry, almost
19, are growing... I wanted it all: art, hus-
band, home, children. I wasn't going to "give
up" anything when I married and I have not.
I haven't singlemindedly pursued recognition,
but I have kept painting...
As for living in Houston, and the some-
what traumatic removal from the northeast-
I like Houston, a lot! It's different: the trees
are different, shrimp plant grows out-of-
doors, the sky is fantastic. When I walk down
the street and see date palms and agave and
cactus, I get a terrific zing. I find the whole
crazy, fierce Texas society exuberant and ex-
pansive. A lot of people here have Indian
grandparents-I like the Mexican and Indian
and cowboy flavor. . . (We'd been living in
rural New Jersey, near exit 5 of the Turnpike,
and believe me, when you talk about nothing,
you are talking about South Jersey.) Hous-
ton is not New York, but there's great poten-
tial and economic opportunity for my kids,
too.
As for art, though, it's a hard go here.
There aren't many galleries and two recently
closed. The most successful ones show estab-
lished New York and California artists and
well-known Texans. The Museum of Fine
Arts is a good institution, but does not in-
volve itself in local art. The Contemporary
Arts Museum tries, but has had all kinds of
mad, incredible management problems. Local
artists seem timid about alternative spaces.
(New York artists are much more aggressive,
right?) Many of them feel almost invisible if
they aren't affiliated with a gallery, but from
what I hear, when they do get into a gallery,
their troubles may just be starting.
I entered the Milliken Rug Competition
in January '78 (found it in WAN) and just
got a certificate of merit from them, a gor-
geous big thing with a gold seal and all kinds
of calligraphy... I've been in a good many
juried local, regional, and national shows and
have some work in books about fiber art...
So I continue just working. I figure things
will develop for me and for the arts in gen-
eral in Houston ...
I really enjoyed writing this letter.
Regards,
Jeanette
Post Script: A recent note from Jeanette
says she's "doing a wild and crazy series of
drawings based on the Statue of LIBerty-
and dinosaurs. When my son was eight, he
thought there were dinosaurs in Texas...
Now, older and wiser (both of us), I'm doing
drawings of dinosaurs in Texas. And still get-
ting to know the city-the people and the
sub-currents-fascinating."
BOOK REVIEW
Playing the Art Machine
by Judy Seigel
Copy Art. Patrick Firpo, Lester Alexander,
and Claudia Katayanagi; opening text by
Steve Ditlea. NY: Richard Marek, 1978.
$7.95, paper.
What possessed the makers of this marvel-
ous book to wrap it in the world's tackiest
cover beats me. Maybe it was the publisher's
bright idea to be "commercial." The blurb.
says, "Turn your local copier into a personal
arts and crafts center," and "Here at last is
an introduction to today's hottest new art
medium." There are three grammatical errors
in the preface, and the first section opens
with these unctuous, inane lines: "Welcome
to the age of Copy Art. Now anyone has the
potential to be an artist or designer at the
push of a button."
So what you do is go directly to page
eight, there to cast your eyes on "Glove
Mudra" by Les Levine and his penetrating
statement:
In order to use copying machines to make art,
three things are absolutely necessary. The first is
crazy wisdom. The second is fearless compassion
and the third is a magic dagger which should be
plunged into the brain one second before the but-
ton on the copying machine is pressed. If all these
three rules are adhered to, a perfect work of art
will result.
It seems that the authors of Copy Art dis-
agreed among themselves about how to de-
scribe the background and contribution of
each, so they left that part out-there is no
biography or crumb of information about
Patrick Firpo, Lester Alexander, Claudia
Katayanagi, or Steve Ditlea; we don't even
learn what city, or for that matter, country.
they live in. One feels the lack. Still, the
book belongs in the library of anyone inter-
ested in copying, printing, photography, ani-
mation, limited editions, crafts-indeed, of
anyone interested in the art of the 20th cen-
tury. It is the smashing catalog for a show
we haven't quite had yet-but maybe some
heads-up curator will get the idea.
After the salvo from Levine, the opening
sections give a rundown on the state of the
art and its history and practitioners, begin-
ning with Sonia Landy Sheridan, who initia-
ted the first copier course at the School of
the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970. (Today
the Generative Systems Department at the
Art Institute offers a master's degree.)
Sheridan says, "We live in an era when art
and science are coming together after having
been split since the Renaissance. Da Vinci
would have had no problem with using a
copier for art."
We read that the 3M Color-In-Color ma-
chine (developed in part with Sheridan as
artist-in-residence) was "truly interactive,
allowing its operator to alter color relation-
ships, values, and density at will." It was driv-
en off the market in 1975 by Xerox Model
6500, which gives color "muddy by compari-
son," but at one third less cost.
There's human drama, too. It took Ches-
ter F. Carlson three years to create the dry-
copy process, then nine more to make a
penny on it. In the interval it cost him "his
marriage, his health, and just, about every
spare cent he earned at his job as a patent
attorney." (Not to worry; he did eventually
become a multi-millionaire.)
Then a "Quick Guide to Copy Processes"
explains the salient features of electrostatic
transfer and electrostatic direct processes,
plus thermographic and photo-chemical

Ann Sutherland Harris said, "These are artists

represent the values of our society. . . Thank
goodness women live a long time and we
won't run out of women to give awards to...
No woman gets sufficient recognition... It's
still difficult to find good books and good
reproductions of the work of even these
famous women."
Eleanor Tufts said: "If I were a painter,
I'd paint like Isabel Bishop."
Isabel Bishop told a story about Jose De
Creeft, who, awarded a medal, said "Thank
you" and sat down. Pressed to say more, he
smiled brilliantly at the audience and said,
"Work! Work!"

Ann Sutherland Harris, introducing Alice
Neel, said that in 50 years of painting, Neel
has "created a visual record of New York and
its people." Her portraits are "profoundly
democratic." Alice Neel said her father told
her, "I don't know what you'll do-you're
only a woman."
Louise Nevelson said the day was impor-
tant, "not only for American women, but for
women all over the world... We've had gods

But the heart and joy of the book is the
"Copy Art Art Section" with reproductions
of work by some 50 artists, a few words on
how each was made, and a statement from
the artist. You may not fully grasp Thomas
Norton's use of a 3-M color copier in a sys-
tem designed by Dr. Robert D. Solomon of
Solotest Corp., in which a black-and-white
video camera picks up an image on a TV
screen and introduces it to a copier, which
transfers it to paper, adding colors in a pro-
cess that takes up to 10 minutes; but the
next image is Peter Thompson's "Phases," a
plant "simply laid on the copier template."
(The image after that, though, is Thompson's
"Print #13.9 from Unit 13," about which I
could understand only that it is made on a
3-M Remote Facsimile Telecopier.)

and I think it fits me like a glove."
Ruth Weisberg read a telegram of thanks
from Georgia O'Keeffe and said, "She speaks
with the flower, bone, and rock... our
shared inspiration."
Mary Ann Tighe said WCA is "one of the
best examples of work by women." During
five years of asking, "Where are the women
artists?" it became a catalyst in national af-
fairs. Tighe said also that the political activ-
ism of women was a factor in her own ap-
pointment to the position she holds at NEA.
unknown, the artists have seduced, coaxed,
or bullied their machines into dazzling per-
formances, from five-cents-plain (but elegant)
black and white to melting color, collaged,
matrixed, mounted, or alone.
The statements, except for the inevitable
pompous or lackluster remark, are another
education. Harris informs us that "When
printed with care and regard to the sensitive
technicalities... a 3M color copy has all
the qualities of a Fine Art Print." Margot
Lovejoy says, "Since the color dyes of the
machine are covered with polymer and are
permanent, if the work is printed on rag sup-
port paper, the resulting print is of archival
quality." From Charlton Burch: "I believe
that the copying machine is perhaps the
greatest reproduction and image-making
tool of the 20th century." Patricia Abbot
says wryly, "The copy machine may have
created a new breed of gambler-the color
copier junkie, unable to stop 'playing it' un-
til it spits out that perfect print." (I must
add here that the book has no index or list
Now the NEA is setting up a "sex-blind ap-
plication review" system, using applicants
first initials instead of first names. Although
there is bound to be "some recognition" of
well-known surnames, she said, "90 percent
of applications are from people whose names
are not known."
WAN is sponsored in part by a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, DC,
a federal agency, and
by the New York State Council on the Arts
of the artists, which is outrageous and unfor-
givable. Even as a casual "cookbook" kind of
affair it should have had an index.)
The last section of the book, "Copy
Crafts," gives a page or so to each of 30 pro-
cesses, from heat transfers (yes, tee-shirts)
and mail art (like postcards) to animation,
masks, and "The Home Press." Under "Tiles"
we find Charlotte Brown's drawings or parts
of paintings that have been run through a 3M
machine onto heat transfer material, then
ironed onto a standard unglazed H&R John-
son Company tile. And for those with access
to one, the Telecopier (3M Remote Facsimile
Machine) boggles the mind with its possibili-
ties.
Imagine: "If you transmit an image at four
minutes and receive it in six minutes, the
image will be compressed... Several people
have experimented with using synthesizers to
modulate Telecopier sounds and therefore
image patterns."
Imagine.

Folk Art & Neo-Folk Art
WCA Panel, Jan. 30, Washington, DC
Judith Stein, Univ. of Pa., mod.; Betty MacDowell,
Mich. State Univ. ("The Legacy of the Lady Lim-
ners: Folk Portraiture by American Women"),
Rachel Maines, Center for the History of American
Needlework, Pittsburgh ("The Designer and Artisan:
The Ancient Contract"), Pat Ferraro, San Francis-
co State Univ. ("Quilts in our Lives"), Miriam
Schapiro, Amherst College, and Melissa Meyer,
NYC ("Femmage," Heresies).
The first WCA panel program, "Folk Art
and Neo-Folk Art," was both exhilarating
and illuminating. Panelists touched on impor-
tant points of original research, while much
of the territory explored was new. Well-cho-
sen slides introduced the work of unknown
women past and present and relevant pieces
by well-known contemporaries. A cloud of
doubt may still linger as to where and when
folk art and naivete give way to professional-
ism, however. MacDowell and Maines assert-
ed that training is the key, but Ferraro, Scha-
piro, and Meyer freely interspersed untrained
artists' work with that of others, without
identification. One was left to make one's
own deductions.
In her introduction, moderator Stein said
that Folk Art as a subject was "discovered"
in the 1920s and that the topic was a first for
both CAA and WCA. She suggested that this
might be because art historians have trouble
dealing with Folk Art as art. Now feminism
makes us aware that women have long stu-
died, collected, and documented (primarily
for themselves and their families) artifacts
and objects of folk art by other women. In a
sense, then, art history has been a means of
social control. Then again, much of this art
is made with relatively cheap materials and/
or discards, and it is possible that art histo-
rians really had difficulty understanding and
appraising it. Now there appears to be a grow-
ing revolution in taste allowing us to begin,
at last, to evaluate and document.
Betty MacDowell, author of a new book,
Artists and Aprons, pointed out that 18th-
and 19th-century women's folk art was
shaped by American culture. Rigid roles in
marriage and parenthood meant that wom-
en's lives were filled with domestic responsi-
bility. Their education stressed needlework,
penmanship, and watercolor along with the
"social graces." Fine arts as a field was dis-
couraged, for women were not to study the
live nude male model! Women channeled
their creativity into the domestic scene; por-
traiture was a natural exploration-familiar
and available faces of family and friends
could be done quickly in pastels or water-

colors, between chores. Women took the
scissors of domesticity to cut paper profiles,
also. MacDowell said repeatedly that the art
had to fit around the accepted patterns of
a woman's life; it rarely even approached a
full-time activity.
By the mid-1800s, demand for portraits
by self-taught artists lessened, due to the ad-
vent of the camera. People preferred the like-
ness of photography to record friends and
family. The disappearance of the naive artist
began.
Rachel Maines traced the professional rela-
tionship between designer and artisan. While
the individual artist has been important since
the Renaissance, little has been written about
the division of labor between the creator of
an idea and the maker-constructor, a division
that may in Europe and America be made
according to class and sex. The designer has
always reigned over the technician. Mechani-
zation of textiles reduced the artisan's role
to mere machine-tender (and began the pro-
ducer-consumer division). The designer-arti-
san contract was originally intended to re-
solve technical problems encountered in the
initial design stage.

In early history, embroiderers tended to
be at a higher level socially. The designer was
part of the staff in wealthy households, and
full-time employment included not only de-
signing the intricate details of clothing, but
also devising patterns for linens, curtains,
rugs, and furniture. Folk embroidery, how-
ever, was produced from designs without di-
rect contact between artist and designer.
Folk artisans borrowed motifs freely from
many diverse traditions and sources and tend-
ed to combine them. Samplers were the work
of students learning stitchery and thus held
even more incongruities.
The earliest commercial needlework used
charts for needlepoint and was done in quad-
rants. At first the designs were hand-painted;
later they were printed. Thread and yarn
manufacturers discovered the advantage of
professional designs, hiring women to draft
patterns derived from popular magazines and
pamphlets. After 1870, charts were available
for beadwork, filet lace and crochet, and

counted cross-stitch.
In the late 1960s, a change began. Now
needleworkers and textile artisans often want
concept and design wed together, although
some do still favor the designer-artisan divi-
sion.
Pat Ferrero traced the life transitions of
women folk artists through their quilts. Baby
quilts could be utilitarian or elaborate or
both at the same time. Quilting skills were
passed from generation to generation, older
women teaching young children. The engage-
ment party was often the occasion for quilt-
ing, while the "masterpiece" was usually the
wedding quilt-carefully conceived and pains-
takingly rendered during the engagement.
The widow's quilt drew on a rich store of
memories. Ferrero showed a quilt made from
a Victorian mourning coat, which had been
opened up to become a ground for both
quilting and embroidery. A coffin in the cen-
ter was surrounded by vignettes of the
quilter's life.
Grace Earl, a transplanted Chicagoan now
working in San Francisco, was seen in several
slides with an incredible array of patterned
fabrics of every description, which, sitting in
her crowded one-room apartment, she pieces
into intricate coverlets of exquisite skill and
conception. (Ferrero has also made a film on
Earl.)
Mimi Schapiro and Melissa Meyer devel-
oped their thesis of "femmage," and also had
a document on the subject, which they hand-
ed out to the audience. This included their
definitions of collage, assemblage, decoupage,
and photomontage as background for their
jointly coined phrase, "femmage." The basic
premise here is that "leftovers" are essential
to a woman's experience. Schapiro pointed
out that most of the classic written works on
collage refer to male artists. Therefore, she
and Meyer developed "femmage" to mean
the same form made solely by women.
Meyer and Schapiro listed several criteria
for "femmage," but were careful to state
that not every one need appear in each ob-
ject. But for the work to be "appreciated" as
"femmage" at least half of the criteria must
be met. These include: being made by a wom-
an, recycling of scraps, saving and collecting,
themes relating to the life context, covert
imagery, diaristic nature, celebration of pri-
vate or public events, expectation of an inti-
mate audience, drawing or handwriting
"sewn" in, silhouetted images fixed on other
material, inclusion of photographs or printed
matter, recognizable images in narrative se-
quence, abstract pattern elements, and the
possibility of a functional as well as an esthet-
ic life for the work. -Barbara Aubin
