GENDER IN ART AN ONGOING DIALOGUE
A.I.R. Dec. 15
Nancy Spero, Mod.; Nancy Kitchel,
Laurace James, Lucy Lippard, Mary
Miss, Rosemary Mayer, Elizabeth
Weatherford, Panelists.
by Sophie Rivera
A group of women artists decided
to express their growing disen-
chantment with the women's movement.
"Gender in Art An Ongoing Dia-
logue," was a title just vague
enough to attract a large turnout
of artists at the AIR gallery.
-
Following a brief slide presen-
tation, moderator/artist Nancy
Spero set the tone with an opening
statement full of vague references
to a meeting the artists had held
several years ago. Spero mentioned
neither the topics discussed nor
the conclusions formulated, just
that they had discussed "a common
bond between women."
The panel, in trying to redefine
"feminist," "feminine," and "fe-
male," were unable to agree, but
initially opted for "female." Ac-
cording to artist Rosemary Mayer "a
feminist esthetic is a very precise
thing; a feminine esthetic is a
lousy term; and a female esthetic
could possibly have meaning."
Before Mayer could elaborate on
the "possibility of meaning," artist/
anthropologist Elizabeth Weatherford
challenged the choice of "female."
She preferred "feminist" to describe
women artists' work but conceded
that "certain stylistic choices are
made."
Critic Lucy Lippard said, "If a
woman is thinking about her work as
by a woman she is probably pre-femi-
nist, post-feminist, or something-
or-other-feminist."
Artist Nancy Kitchel said, "so
little imagery is left to be ap-
plied to female, feminine, and femi-
nist art." After using the panel's
terms, Kitchel bemoaned the fact
that "art has been separated by its
terminology out of the stream of
human activity" so far as to become
a "separate category alien to the
artists' intentions."
Spero pointed out that Rosemary
Mayer's sculptures were titled with
the names of great and powerful
women. Yet Mayer claimed her in-
tention was not really feminist.
"My work was feminist to the ex-
tent that I thought people should be
aware of the lives and activity of
'those women. It was not feminist
to the extent that I thought those
forms were female," answered Mayer.
She elaborated on the stereotypes
associated with art done with
stitching and fabric. There was no
general agreement about the rele-
vance of techniques learned by wom-

THOUGHTS PROVOKED BY A "GENDER-IN-ART" PANEL
by Joan Semmel
The impetus for the woman's move-
ment in the art world was blatant
discriminaion, exclusion and isola-
tion. It was important for many of
us in the early years to have the
opportunity to see each other's
work, and to gain the confidence to
further develop and expand our own
work. We then returned to our pri-
vate worlds to work intensively,
gradually gaining exposure, first in
women's shows, then in wider contexts.
The profusion of women's panels
this season is a signal that we are
once again seeking nurturance from
each other, and that the movement is
readying itself for the next stage
in its development. Unfortunately
many of the panels have failed to
deal with the substantive issues and
have left us with an aftertaste of
frustration and negation.
A panel that calls itself "Gender
In Art-An Ongoing Dialogue" and then
refuses to deal with content or
sources, or gender itself except in
terms of careerism, does a disser-
vice to us all.
Because women's work has been
discriminated against for years,
many women are paranoid about having
their art described as distinc-
tively female, feminist, or femi-
nine. Some think women's art should
be accepted because it is the same,
or as good as, men's. I want it to
be accepted because it is dif-
ferent. Therein lie its power and
its possibilities.
Has art made by women been ex-
cluded from the cultural mainstream
simply because of the prevalence
of discriminatory practices against
women? Or because it also often
validates an experience, a female
experience, one from which the male
world feels excluded? Is it not from
this very validation that women's
art derives its special authenti-
city? Is it not time that the female

ART OFFENDS
AT DOUGLASS
by Anne Marie Rousseau
Bibi Lencek, 41st in the Women
Artists Series at Mabel Douglass
College Library, showed, thru Nov.
21, paintings of a young couple
(modelled by Lencek and companion)
in various positions of lovemaking.
Done in a cool realistic style, the
paintings used such "banal" details
as patterned sheets, tissue box,
wall plug, and potted plant to give
a "sense of place." Ms. Lencek says
that although the figures are prom-
inent, she considers them "merely a
part of an indoor landscape."
In a letter to Targum, the Rut-
gers newspaper, Douglass Student
Barbara Ambler protested the show.
It was, she said, distracting, "un-
dermining the quality of my life"
as a Christian. She wished to lead
a life "pleasing to God," but sex
"in the wrong situation...can de-
stroy us." Another letter from a
more worldly student protested the
portrait of Alexander in the Alex-
ander Library, because "each time I
see it I begin to fantasize about
sex."
Although most students seemed
neutral or unconcerned, the dis-
tress of the minority was so acute
that an open forum was held, Nov.
11.
Protestors included Ms. Ambler
and other members of the Intervar-
sity Christian Fellowship. Espous-
ing a "Christian Ethic," they ob-
jected to public display of work
which aroused sexual fantasy. Sex
is "a beautiful gift from God,"
they said, but belongs only within
the bonds of "Holy Matrimony." One
student read from the Bible of Adam
and Eve's recognition of their na-
kedness and covering themselves,
from which he inferred the sinful-
ness of the naked body. Turning to
Ms. Lencek, he said, "The Devil
speaks to us in many ways."
A more lenient faculty and ad-
ministration noted that artists
have for centuries depicted male
and female nudes in secular and re-
ligious paintings, mentioning Ti-
tian, Rubens and Ingres. One fac-
ulty member observed, "These are Feming
not sweaty paintings," noting that
no genitalia were portrayed. Re-
viewer Lynn Bershak said, "Lencek Am
alters the positions of the lovers
as one would re-position flowers or
Serial
fruit in a bowl...lovemaking is a A79)
subject for genre painting" like
nursing mothers or children at play.
Robert Tanksley, Co-ordinator for
Religious Affairs, noted that spir-
itual asceticism is achieved by
confrontation and transcendance,
not avoidance.
Assistant Professor Gloria Oren-
stein said that after her trip each

A Philadelphia Story
The Philadelphia Museum of Art
sent a form letter to galleries
(picked up by a WAN correspondant at
a Solo Co-op) inviting entries for
an American Family show in '76. The
letter specified conditions of sub-
mission in detail--photos and slides
to be returned, Xeroxes not, etc.
Taking this at face value, WAN
reprinted the information for its
readers (Nov.). But the museum was
annoyed to receive such entries,
even those including return enve-
lope. Tara Glass Robinson, Co-ordi-
nator of Exhibitions, wrote us that
this was not an open show, and that
it was, in fact, already selected
(reported in Dec. WAN).
Please tell us--when is an in-
vitation not an invitation?
What is an open show?

REPRESENTATION
ARTISTS TALK ON ART Nov. 21.
Louis Finkelstein, Mod.; Rosemarie
Beck, Paul Georges, Wolf Kahn,
Raoul Middleman, Paul Resika,
Panelists.
I loved this panel for its
warmth and camaraderie, even or es-
pecially for its practiced passions:
Resika rhapsodizing on a tear duct;
Georges in a funny and fiery attack
on the Met, the French show, the
academic mind and "naked represen-
tation"; Kahn in a confessional
mood: Middleman in two hilarious
anecdotes on the clues to likeness
or how we recognize each other;
Beck more reserved and thoughtful;
moderator Finkelstein saying affec-
tionately, but probably meaning it,
that if Georges were any more suc-
cessful, he'd be unbearable.
I loved the panel's intimacy
with the works which concerned it.
Though I knew they'd fought these
fights before, I could even empa-
thize with their delight in landing
a few blows on the dead horse of
abstraction. Lastly, Georges on
Leslie's second O'Hara: "I was so
happy to see the improvement--he
finally got that big foot out. The
trouble is, that painting needed a
big foot!"

Art Workers News and the Council
Is it naive to expect a govern-
ment body, such as the New York
State Council on the Arts, to fund
a group criticizing it, in this case
the Foundation for the Community of
Artists?
Letters To The Editor
Dear Editors,
A propos of Phoebe Hellman's re-
marks reported in Women Artists
Newsletter Nov. 1975: the tampaxes
distributed at the Whitney Museum
five years ago in the Ad Hoc pro-
The grounds originally given by tests were nice clean ones, marked,
the Council for de-funding the Com- as I recall, "50% women" (refer-
munity were that it and its publica- ring to the Annual), not, in any
tion, Art Workers News, are no long-case, tainted by the "dirt" some
er needed. Given the present legal, well-conditioned people still asso-
economic and tax status of artists, ciate with menstruation!
that statement is absurd.
Art Workers News can be dull and
unfocused, but no more so than a lot
of art funded by the Council. AWN in-
vestigations of dangers of art ma-
terials, workings of art bureau-
cracies, studies of legislation, and
programs of insurance for artists
may not make titillating reading,
but they benefit all artists. If
some of AWN's advocacies have been
unrealistic, their reports on appli-
cations of art moneys are indeed
real, and their protests led the
council to establish appeals pro-
cedures where none had existed, and,
for the first time, to promulgate a
set of guidelines.
There should be open guidelines,
publicly accounted for--a necessary
antidote to bureaucratic whim. For
instance: funds should go to pro-
jects the private sector can't or
doesn't provide, should deliver for
artists, not administrators, and be
allocated according to a merit sys-
tem more impersonal than the pre-
sently operative one.
One thinks of NYSCA projects that
are the cosy fiefdoms of a few and
their cronies. The Community of
Artists operates in the general in-
terest, as advocates of all artists.
It should have the funds to do a
proper job.

KANE: You have the makings of a

in the exhibition.
BABER: ...Some artists sent in a
poem. Others wrote a biographical
statement, sent photos of them-
selves, or works in the show, or
other works. There are four vol-
umes on display. Of course the
ideal situation would have included
more space, more time, and many
more countries.
KANE: Current trends are recog-
There have been so many inaccu-
rate accounts of the early days of
the women artists' movement that I
guess the time has come to start
correcting the basic facts, even as
minor as this one.
And, incidentally, while my view
of what happens at these panels
doesn't always coincide with that of
your writers, I think it's a ter-
rific idea to cover them so thor-
oughly. Many thanks.

Dear Ms.
Lucy R. Lippard, New York
My entry form for the Marietta
Art Show has arrived and I notice
it is an all man selection jury--I
enclose their aims (see below). I
am not entering this show.
-Carolyn Berry, Monterey, CA.
Mainstreams '76 will promote the
concept that the qualities in art
to which man personally reacts are
those that are symbols of man's
existence and his involuntary quest
for beauty. These qualities bridge
all centuries, all art styles, and
are, apparently, very close to the
essence of man's communication with
man. Our purpose is to bring, inso-
far as possible, the best examples.
of painting and sculpture to our
college and community.

Sleigh Letter Corrected
WAN has shot its proofreader at
dawn. Sylvia Sleigh's letter last
month was intended to clarify, not
further confuse. A WAN quote, "It's
time for a major museum to do a ma-
jor show of women, not one started
and paid for by women," might in
the context have been taken to refer
to the Women Choose Women show at
the NY Cultural Center. In that
show, as Sleigh wrote, "The only
obligation on exhibiting artists
was to deliver their work, and the
catalog was funded."
But many, like Louise Nevelson,
Betty Parsons, Ruth Frankin, Hedda
Sterne, and Addie Herder simply
seem to be doing their own thing
nizable. For instance, collage el- and always have.
ements...in the work of Mimi
Schapiro and the sculpture of
Eugenie Gershoy. Patterns in Joyce
Kozloff's paintings have echoes of
the American Indian, as well as
quilt-like pattern that recalls
Appalachian handiwork....
...Joan Semmel's work has
more to do with the current inter-
est in erotic art. Alice Neel has
always done her own thing in those
penetrating, uncomfortable por-
traits. She has always held up a
taut psychological mirror. But, I
can't say that it's particularly
female. Perhaps Sylvia Sleigh's
interest in subject matter is femi-
nine, but the work itself is not...
I think Elise Asher's work has al-
ways been crisply feminine, in a
very pretty and poetic way--rather
like a self-portrait in calligraphy.
Did you have trouble getting
work from such countries as Turkey,
Iran and India?
BABER: Luckily I was able to bor-
row those from the Grey Gallery at
NYU. It was important to show that
women all over the world from many
diverse backgrounds are working in
the arts. Yes, many countries
don't allow paintings to be sent
out of the country, or, in some
cases, to return. Getting work
through customs can be a serious
problem.
KANE: ... I know how much time a
project like this can take. What
satisfactions did it give?
BABER: ... Showing some of these
artists for the first time in NY
was gratifying, especially in in-
ternational women's year... It was
an exciting experience...

ART TO HEART TALK
Panel-HUMANIZING THE ART WORLD-12/13
Joellen Bard, Mod; Diane Burko, Rich-
ard Karp, Cindy Nemser, Jonathan
Price, Jacqueline Skiles, Panelists.
The seemingly well-fed, well-
dressed, well-educated "humanists"
on this panel about "Humanizing the
Art World" are outraged at a system
which has allowed them this much,
but, to date denied them the fame,
wealth or power they see elsewhere.
Their talk mixed truth impar-
tially with nonsense. The salient
truth was Jackie Skiles' observa-
tion that the moneys going into Art
Councils across the land have cre-
ated thousands of middle class jobs
with fringe benefits for arts ad-
ministrators, but have moved
scarcely an artist into the middle
class.
On balance, though, the foolish-
ness bothered me more than the
truths roused me, and, wincing at
the howlers, I began to apply a
kind of "Yeah, Like" clause in my
mind, as antidote to the effects of
blither on my pre-holiday psyche.
Here, more or less verbatim, are
some of their sillier assertions
and my irritated replies:
THEM: It is content that infuses
art with vitality.
ME: Yeah, like the painting of the
most beautiful object in the world
is the most beautiful painting in
the world.
THEM: Corporations promote ab-
stract art because aesthetics are
safe. Stripes, circles, etc. won't
propagate revolutionary ideas.
ME: Yeah, like the Constructivists
The Book As Art-Standing Bookstructures - Painted Plexiglass
FENDRICK GALLERY - Washington, D.C.
January 9 through February 8, 1976
and Futurists did abstract art to
support monarchy.
THEM: The artistic object today
often has nothing to do with the
world beyond it.
ME: Yeah, like what is art, anyway?
THEM: Artists start with warm and
spiritual, rather than pragmatic
things.
ME: Yeah, like crucifixions, flag-
ellations, battle scenes and grids.
THEM: Humanism means warmth, ten-
derness, kindness to neighbors and
sharing.
ME: Yeah, like rage and aggression
are purely aesthetic.
Rejection is
THEM: What's wrong with being re-
fused [from a co-op]?
humanistic, too.
ME: Yeah, like "warmth, tenderness,
kindness to neighbors and sharing."
If "humanizing the art world" is
a code phrase to mean wrenching
power from the fallible humans who
now possess it, I'm interested, but
the pious cant is distracting.
Any extension of human thinking,
from Fibonacci to the Pyramids, is
"humanistic." Limiting art to
"pictures," so-called "explorations
of self" and a few other minor
genres, curbs art and intellect as
much as "inevitable progression"
ever did. Who needs a know-nothing
backlash in the name of "humanism"?

WOMEN LOOK AT WOMEN
"Women Look at Women," the work
of 30 women photographers from the
permanent files of the Library of
Congress closed Dec. 31 in Washing-
ton. 150 pieces selected from the
show, from the 1890's through the
present, will tour the country be-
ginning in January.
The exhibitors deserve credit
for the vision and patience neces-
sary to sift through the Library's
vast collection of Imogen Cunning-
ham, Laura Gilpin, Marion Post
Wolcott, Gertrude Käsebier, Toni
Frissell, Dorothea Lange, Diane
Arbus and others. But the imposed
subtitles--"As Women Alone," "As
Modern Women,' " "On the Farm," "As
Wives," "As Mothers," etc.--are
often distracting and irrelevant.
Simple chronology might have better
paralleled the changes in the women,
their medium and subject matter.
But the show is well worth see-
ing--for the glory of these impor-
tant artists grouped together--an-
other reminder of our collective
wealth.

fields, scenes of love were a re-
lief and reminder of good in human-

that the art was a joyous distrac-

painting gas stations was more
truly pornographic.
Several students admitted they
hadn't really looked at the paint-
ings. Thinking they had learned
something about art, they agreed to
try again. (One said that although
he came to the library often, he
hadn't noticed the art until he
read about it in the paper.) Lynn

whom the show had offended, but an-

Now in its fifth year, the Women
Artists Series began as an informal
effort to fly the flag for women
artists at a woman's college with
primarily male art professors.
tist Joan Snyder had approached
Daisy Brightenback, head librarian
in 1971, with the idea of using the
library walls as an alternative
space for showing women's work. Al-
though many women were working,
painting and producing at the time,
few had opportunities to show. Sym-
pathetic, Brightenback turned the
project over to Lynn Miller, then a
new librarian eager to make the li-
brary exciting. She and Snyder got
a little money from the library
budget, scrambled for transporta-
tion, hitched trailers to Miller's
station wagon, rented trucks, got
parking tickets, argued with po-
licemen, and working with the ar-
tists, put together the early shows.
From the first mimeographed an-
nouncement to the present profes-
sional catalog, media coverage, im-
pressive roster of participating
artists, and, as Ms. Miller says,
"everyone in the WORLD sending in
slides," has been a long road and a
major achievement.

en growing up and their application
to a feminist consciousness in art.
The discussion had little to do
with the stated subject. Some of
the panelists commented on the male
dominance of the art world--a theme
which surfaced early, got lost,
then re-surfaced in response to
sharp audience questioning. The
audience expressed feelings of pow-
erlessness in a male dominated so-
ciety. Artist Joan Semmel answered
that women are our audience, that
women have a gut response to art,
and that her own art came out of a
sense of powerlessness (although
Semmel no longer feels powerless).
Spero strongly disagreed. One could
not help get the feeling that we
were listening to an economic theo-
ry, that many of the women were in-
terested only in the marketing and
marketability of feminist art.
The heart of the dilemma seems
to be the intrinsic value versus
the extrinsic commodity value of
art. As to whether there is a spe-
cific female art form--a panelist
asserted that the traditional fe-
male approach has been to reach out,
while the male approach has been to
look into himself in order to cre-
ate. This was directly contradicted
by statements of at least half a
dozen women about their own crea-
tivity.
The confusion deepened when some-
one mentioned that she had been
reading a book claiming that people
were pushed, because of education,
away from the visual toward the ver-
bal. This led to the speculation
that female and male spatial per-
ceptions are different--a useful
statement, if true, but taken
wholly out of context.
The discussion might more appro-
priately have been titled: "Dis-
gruntled Artists Lower Conscious-
ness." Despite claims of innova-
tion, the ground had been gone over
before.
[Next month: Nancy Spero]
Semmel continued
experience became part of the making
of our collective history, of our
supposedly collective culture, where
it may serve to modify some of the
anti-humanistic tendencies of that
culture?
Do we as women artists conscious-
ly seek the sources of our work?
Some women are afraid that the seek-
ing of those sources will be ideolo-
gically coercive. I disagree. Self-
knowledge stimulates self-defini-
tion.
If women's art encompasses a wide
range of styles, are there simi-
larities in content? What in our re-
lationship to our space, to time, to
materials, to our sexual roles, is
different from men's and how does
this affect our work? Why does so
much of women's art deal with sexual
motifs, organic form, autobio-
graphy, process and craft materials,
highly personal and non-hierarchic
form? How does this overlap with
tendencies in women's writing?
The questions are endless. It is
time for an ongoing dialogue.

nection, it's a pity that Munster-
berg did not include a bibliography.
He's also evasive about gender de-
scriptions of art, telling us for
example that Laurencin's work is
usually seen as "feminine, meaning
that it is gentle and poetic rather
than bold and expressive." And his
views about stature and influence
can be questioned along with the
odd suggestion that "for some rea-
son, women are more gifted ver-
bally than visually." But the
book's limits make our questions,
or complaints about the omission of
(say) American quiltmakers, or
Grace Hartigan, beside the point.
However, Munsterberg does whet the
appetite and his work should en-
courage others to go further.

BOOK REVIEWS
ISABEL BISHOP
by Karl Lunde
Harry N. Abrams, Inc. NYC 1975 $37
171 illustrations, including
50 plates in full color
"No painting ever seems 'fin-
ished, even after many months of
work: there is simply a time when
she can do no more with it. She
tries to express in a painting the
unfinished quality of life." So
writes Karl Lunde of the work of
Isabel Bishop in his introductory
essay to the recent volume repro-
ducing paintings, drawings, and
etchings. Isabel Bishop has been
captivated primarily by one subject
--the men and women who live and
work in the vicinity of her Union
Square studio. She depicts their
everyday gestures and momentary,
unconscious actions, making us see
the monumental in the commonplace
and transitory.
This book does justice to Isabel
Bishop's work. The reproductions
are excellent, the etchings full
scale in most cases. Bishop first
does studies, then etchings and
aquatints, which prepare for the
paintings. This process is de-
scribed with great sensitivity.
Isabel Bishop is a truly beautiful
book; it gives the feeling of pos-
sessing the works of the artist.

"The Nude in Photography," by
Arthur Goldsmith. Ridge and Playboy
Press, 1975. $19.95
This lap-sized, pseudo-intell-
tual presentation of the mostly fe-
male nude as seen by fine-art and
commercial photographers would have
fared better as two books.
In the chapter called "Scandalous
Beginnings," we are drawn to the
strength of Muybridge's still-photo
action sequences of the male and fe-
male model, to the delicacy and
great charm of the French picture
postcards, to Bellocq's keen and
sympathetic portrayal of a New
Orleans prostitute, and to the
unique visions of Weston, Lange and
Morgan. The Playboy-style pictures
done by Look, Life and SatEve Post
photographers appeal to other sensi-
bilities. The final chapters are an
unhomogeneous mix of commercial,
semi-pornographic, fine-art (the
primal nudes of D. Niccolini) and
experimental work. The text should
have been set apart from the pic-
tures--not placed on most of the
pages as small bits of chattery
prose.
However, if you received ‘this
book for Christmas, it is fun--if
you are a woman, to compare your
body with the great variety of nudes
here, and, if you are male, to pick
and choose and daydream over all
the girls.

Art on the Edge - Harold Rosenberg.
Macmillan Publishing Company, 1975
$12.95
Rosenberg's tall figure stalking
the art world or sitting back,
stiff leg out, observing the events
to which the professional art watch-
er must attend--developments of the
past fifteen years have forced him
to an ironical distance. The
ideals, however, of the early years
as poet, Marxist and friend of the
artist remain the standard against
which all else is measured.
Seen from Rosenberg's distance,
the busy-ness of the art world
takes on a faint Swiftian tint--is
silhouetted and flattened. For ex-
ample: his use of the word, "Mof-
fetters" to refer to those who
agree with curator Kenworth Mof-
fett's assessment of Olitski.
this one mild word, Rosenberg
dwarfs the actors on the stage;
they grow down, quaint and squat,
the "preeminence" of Olitski with
them.
With
These "Moffetters" are to be
found astride the first segment of
Rosenberg's new book, "Art on the
Edge," in which 28 essays in three
sections called Creators, Reflec-
tions and Situations are assembled
and directed to a point. The book's
title derives from one of the con-
cluding chapters, "On the Edge,"
in which the Brobdingnagian feats
of "Dccumenta 5" are discussed.
the foreword Rosenberg states:
"...this prolific support of art
and hyperanimation of the art scene
themselves carry the danger of pro-
pelling painting and sculpture over
the edge that separates them from
the crafts, commercial design and
the mass media. "
In
We know that the significance of
"Documenta 5" was inflated precise-
ly by the sum of two million dol-
lars but can this be seen as "pro-
lific support of art"--an extrava-
ganza which includes a token few
paintings & sculptures under the
banner "Art is Superfluous"? If
official salons are accurate in-
dexes of the direction art is tak-
ing, then art is heading "over the
edge."
