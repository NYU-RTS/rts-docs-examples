CONTENT:
Feminist art theory and practice in the 1990s has moved way beyond critiquing the exisiting patriarchy. It is now proposing new questions that are expressed in art - for instance, shows like Mary Ann Wadden's "Original Sin" at the Hillwood Art Gallery (C.W. Post Campus, L.I. University) and find their starting point in the elsewhere of evolving American feminist art criticism, i.e. Jane Kaufman. These activist practices are incredibly threatening to the patriarchy and certain of their assumptions.

The relationship that has been in force between the sexes has been male dominant. To question this and construct different alternatives or, as postmodernist jargon would have it, "discourses" became the task of feminists in the 1970s. Accused of simple-mindedness by male critics who had been supportive during the male-defined "golden age" of feminist art and criticism, i.e., Lawrence Alloway, feminist art critics of the 1980s attempted to create conceptions that rejected male experience as "universal." Unfortunately, this process led many to bind themselves to male authority in order to refute it. Take for instance the English feminists who concentrated on the "Woman Question" first identified by Engles and Marx or the new postmodern feminists who bound themselves to the male dominant theories of Foucault or Lacan. All of these masculine-based theories of culture and about women had biases of their own which rarely paid attention to the reality of women's experience within their own sphere, i.e., biochemistry and the body. They were essentially resistant to feminist interventions, and although savvy women were able to write essays on the cutting edge of criticism, these writings were mainly shaped by ideas originating in white Euro-centric discourses, i.e., Plato, Hobbes, Hegel, Freud, Marx and Sartre to mention only a few. The most radical feminist critics generally found themselves shut out of the major trade journals and could find a voice only in magazines which were marginal to the established and centrist mainstream. Many found themselves publishing their best work in catalogs and popular media.

This is a short overview of the past two decades of discussions centering on the feminist critique in the arts, which brings us to the threshold we now stand on. The 1990s promises well,.but proponents of activist criticism have their work cut out for them. Racism and sexism within the feminist movement itself may handicap us from our aspirations. It is absurd to assume we all have the same goals. What we have to do is recognize our various concerns and the common ground we share as women in a sexist society. We must honestly examine our approaches, philosophies and attitudes. Concepts of gender and difference are at the forefront of developing feminist perspectives; this will require us to broaden our horizons, risking crossing borders that are foreign to us. How we are going to (re) construct our differing aims and eliminate male bias in creating systems and theories using feminist methods is the big question for feminist critics and artists in the 1990s.

Fall 1991 in New York will long be remembered for the city-wide exhibitions at museums and galleries of the art of Mexico. The most exciting event, and the one generating the greatest interest, was the National Academy's landmark show on women artists. The exhibition, catalog and symposium are all reviewed in these pages.

No matter how you say it, Latin American women have arrived in New York. The big apple is agog over Frida Kahlo and Mexico as exotica. Elle ran a story on Frida and juxtaposed Frida's self-portraits with fashionable photographs of models dressed in Mexican-style clothes. If this all smacks of sensationalism you ain't heard nothing yet. Films, books, and all sorts of events featuring Frida Kahlo as a role model are the enriched wonder bread of the season, topped off by Madonna's recent hit tune "Vogue" in which she sings "Come on, girls, let's get to it, strike a pose, there's nothing to it." All this is very provocative when one thinks of the sense of power "dressed to kill" conveys to a younger generation, especially in terms of women using their sexuality. Retrogressive, in feminist terms, as all this is, it makes me think of another pop song "What's love got to do with it?" By the same logic, I'm moved to ask what's art got to do with it? The answer seems to be almost nothing-since it's about commercialism. The media focus is limited to Frida, who has become a hot commodity, particularly since Madonna and other pop stars have purchased her art for record prices.

Still, "Women in Mexico" makes very interesting viewing, featuring over one hundred works by 22 women artists. By no means what it might have been had curator Edward Sullivan been given more time, it yet illustrates the extraordinary contributions women have made to Mexico's cultural history in the 20th century. Dr. Edward Sullivan, Chair of the Department of Fine Arts at New York University, covers such themes as national identity, personal and psychological identity, fantasy, abstract expressionism, women's role in society, and contemporary pluralism and illustrates them with artists including Kahlo, María Izquierdo, Olga Costa, Remedios Varo, Leonora Carrington, Lola Alvarez Bravo, Graciela Iturbide, Flor Garduño, Lilia Carillo, Laura Anderson, Tina Modotti and Elena Climent.

Sullivan's exhibition is radical, so it was hard to understand some of his exclusions. Later he told me the exhibition is only an ambitious first and he intends to follow it with an inclusive book. He welcomes contributions to his list. He is to be commended for providing us, at short notice, with a discursive space in which to discuss Latin American and Hispanic women. Choosing the "most representative figures for most trends of the time period dealt with" was Sullivan's immediate objective. It makes for a very interesting show. I was sorry to see him uncritically accept the Gouma-Peterson and Mathews "The Feminist Critique...,"which appeared in The Art Bulletin as a definitive source viz. the history of the women's movement in art. It is essentially a sequence of windy generalizations that confuses more than it enlightens.

I was pleasantly surprised by a number of new faces and particularly liked the inclusion of photography and younger contemporary artists. Frida Kahlo's life enters into her art, and in many of her paintings she shows herself as a mere child with a crush on the great hero Diego Rivera. In pictures like the Little Deer where she is shot through with pain she reminds us of her dependency on Rivera and her own personal courage. In Diego Y Yo (1949) he is engraved on her brain like a third eye.

There is something savage in the realities these women depict that is not Mexican. Remedios Varo came to Mexico from Spain in 1941 and soon after struck up a friendship with the American Leonora Carrington. Her The Creation of Birds (1958) is an alchemistical and surreal imaging of her own artistic liberation. Her painting, like Kahlo's, is precise, jewel-like and intimate. Leonora Carrington, like Varo, has a violent and spiritual edge to her art. It is a transformative vision that imposes a special kind of attention on its viewer. Works like Temple of the Wing (1954), Samam (1951) and Down Below (1942 are metamorphic and full of occult symbolism.

Lucero Isaac's mixed media sculptures Downstairs to Heaven. Act II (1989) and Devilish Viewer (1989) make a respectable bid for appreciation. I particularly like Laura Anderson's The Sacred and The Profane (1989) and "The Origins" series. In these drawings she embodies the profound sexual energy of the spiritual. The work consists of large, energetic drawings using carbon graphite and ink on paper. In spirit and basic understanding there is an innocence and pathos that is immediate and disconcerting because it anticipates the physical and spiritual as a continuous moment of becoming in which we don't know which is sacred or profane. It is the intensity of Anderson's vision that is so refreshing. Elena Climent, who is largely self-taught, uses the most mundane subject matter. But each moment she paints has a uniqueness that intends to capture something singularly Mexican. Climent constructs her pictures from the debris of everyday life in Mexico City - gas station altars, candid close-up views of middle-class interiors full of cheap religious and secular images, plastic lace, fading photographs and assorted other trash. What is particularly gratifying about these works is their deeply humane approach and genuine love for and realism about human beings.

A few comments about the photography. Tina Modotti's work conceptualized the mood of nationalism throughout Mexico during the time that she worked there. She was influential and influenced other native photographers with images like El Machete (ca. 1928). Lola Alvarez Bravo's photograph The Dream of the Poor impressed me deeply. It shows a small boy asleep among several hundred sandals. He is a pure presentation-only a peasant-a symbol of the Mexican people. He is displaced and at a loss amid plenty. We haven't the slightest idea of what his dreams are. We only have a suspicion from Bravo's boldly discordant placement that he dreams about plenty of something. Bravo's photographs of the painter María Izquierdo (1947) and Diego Rivera (ca. 1945) are direct and display an intensity of seeing that makes the record of their faces a record of a prodigious animal power to endure.

Graciela Iturbide's photographs are the work of a woman who evidently understands the absurdity of modern life in Mexico. Her wildly discordant and satiric Angel Woman shows a woman dressed in what appears to be traditional costume striding across a rugged landscape. The embodiment is heroic, but upon closer examination we notice that she is carrying a portable radio. Iturbide collapses the barriers between a multitude of cultural clashes blending them into one ironic statement about how we exist in the same space - only very differently. More cutting is her The Border (1989) in which a man with a tattooed back, sporting an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, faces the horizon. Here she presents the human predicament where we are to be pitied and laughed at as we face the changing and unchanging realities of the world we have created. In her Powerful Hands she shows two generations of women, possibly a mother and daughter, in front of an assemblage of sculpted wooden hands. This moment reflects an undervalued wisdom of heart and spirit that have remained unchanged since ancient times.

In works by Iturbide and Flor Garduño, especially her incredibly powerful and compelling Warsau #46 (1987) and Knives (1987) we seem to be dealing with a continuous and unfinished journey that mirrors the history of Mexico and humanity.

In summary, this is a show that ventured too little and its pseudo-Mexicanism made me grit my teeth, since I expected it to be rooted in artists of Mexico. Given the prohibitive price of the catalog ($110) I was disappointed that no biographical material was included in the exhibition. Though every performance has its limits, the show transcended them by introducing us to a number of women artists who need to be better known, including María Izquierdo, Olga Costa, Sylvia Ordóñez and Mariana Yampolsky. Much as I mistrust the political climate that has treated us to this Mexican extravaganza I think the National Academy of Design and the Centro Cultural Arte Contemporaneo deserve a round of applause for creating an opportunity for a wider audience to become acquainted with these artists.

CONTENT:
From the Oedipal myth, Plato and Aristotle, through Augustine's Confessions and Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, to Derrida and his followers' relatively recent fashionable writing on language and literature, ideas of desire have engaged the Western imagination. This frame of reference weighed heavily on "Locations of Desire" curated by Terry Suhre, but raised some questions. Where do discourse and painting meet and part ways? Since desire - to have, be understood, know, love, go beyogd has been mapped from Logos to belly button, what's left to say, specifically, in terms of painting? Phyllis Bramson, Michiko Itatani, and Vera Klement addressed these questions gamely, and in radically different ways.

Itatani's huge black and white paintings take big risks and have the muscle to carry them off. Bodies with bulging, twisting sinews lock in combat and explode across the canvas, some bent double, as if giving birth to themselves, or falling into their omphalos, after Freud. Heads are missing or distorted as if by the velocity with which they traverse tightly drawn planes or grids. Dopplegangers clutch their counterparts and Ego wars with Id. All are titans. An expansive painter who doesn't hide behind theory or irony, Itatani doesn't suffer from anxiety of influence either. Smashed under and across the tight grids, with their computer graphic look, her wide curved brushstrokes are nakedly expressive and romantic. Her images of flying primordial struggle plunder Blake's prophetic poems, with their Miltonic winds and Biblical and classical allusions, but Itatani's paintings are stronger than Blake's watercolors. Her images have still other antecedents in Goya's Black Paintings and Bacon, but the black and white makes them more bearable, if not too sanitary, Frankenstein gray notwithstanding.

Though her painting is the opposite of classic, there is a classic transparency in the way Itatani translates ideas. Startlingly explicit in using signs and symbols of power, hers by right-she engages the Western canon with reversals, not apparent in the work itself-she's from Japan. One could fault Itatani for not handling this dynamite critically enough. She risks some of the tradition's own puffed up tendencies. It would be more politically correct at least to subvert some of the ever-stunning machismo of the archetypes, but she surely levels some stereotypes of artists. Moreover, the mix of images from literature as well as painting sufficiently complicates the issue to exonerate her awesome achievement.

Whatever she depicts, the location of desire for Itatani in these paintings is power. The sheer ambition of her undertaking provokes questions people have stopped asking. What's the difference between image as signifier and a painting's body? Finish? Itatani's sharp contrasts form a strong skeletal composition; the quick line of a thigh sets it in motion. It's all there. Or is it? Would she do better to abandon the gargantuan foot and wimp out like Michelangelo with niceties of draughtsmanship in the extremities, or not? Trade off size for depth of painting (having already scaled down her work, which still over-flows the walls)? Make a three-mile painting with no trade-offs? The work can take such questions, trifling to serious, and they become relevant in view of what it transmits, and of what Itatani seems to be reaching for without apology masterpieces.

Klement takes a humbler approach. With a few lines, patch of canvas or muted plane, images of thresholds and doors, she locates desire in a blank to be filled. Thin washes of gray have a mildewed look where faint constellations take shape as if by natural processes. A smidgeon of light defines a horizon, and patterns to the left suggest book binding, pages to be turned. These pieces rely a good deal on the viewer, in Minimalist fashion, and vital inconsistencies in the work show an unwillingness to settle into a mode, risking change. In her most recent paintings, Klement seems to have scraped paint right off the palette, or used the canvas as palette, juxtaposing thin washes with thick gobs of paint modeled into images - a birch, a river. Several heavily textured images are stranded on raw canvas, which, in the context of desire, is perhaps a witticism the canvas seems to be wanting something.

Bramson is unconcerned with min-max modes. Her canvases are filled with comic strip or storybook-style figures that serve a narrative function. Images of hearts, spleens or eggplants, and potted plants clutter up split planes of color that rub against each other. Figures squat on opposite sides of a pattern of signs making hand gestures. A woman aghast holds an uprooted tree, and a pig-tailed person turns away, about communication, locating desire (as motive for language) in the need to be understood, or in the Other. What holds them all together is color. Orange desires its blue complement; red desires green, they meet in a gray in-between zone. In short, this binding medium shows that desire, for Bramson, is in the eye's appetite.

The catalog argues unpersuasively that Bramson, Itatani, and Klement are similar, mainly because they are different from other artists. But their essential dissimilarity is no failing of the show, which instead makes a person think. The three artists's work can be seen at their respective Chicago galleries, Roy Boyd, Dart, and Deson-Saunders.

CONTENT:
The art historical canon has stressed the achievements of male artists, describing them as heros, geniuses and victors. This jargon of war evidently was not intended to include the limp wrist gay artist poetically depicting a gay subculture. In this galaxy of stars there has been little room for either daughters or gay and lesbian artists.

In the last few years the discipline of art history, with its double standards of evaluation, has been challenged and modified by the special concerns of a generation of new writers on art working out of poststructural and postmodern models of inquiry. To varying degrees, thinkers such as James Saslow, Emmanuel Cooper, Douglas Crimp, Harmony Hammond, Arlene Raven and Lucy Lippard have alerted us to the need to deal with sexuality openly in order to assess the work and lives of artists without the prejudice, distortion and myth surrounding the homosexual presence in visual art.

So in looking at "The Queer Show" I was happy to see that the problem that lesbians have been deprived of a political existence through "inclusion" as female versions of male homosexuality was finally raised. In a man-made world there is an active homosexual eroticism which manifests itself in a variety of visual forms from the Golden Age of the Greeks on in history painting and sculpture. Although such objectification appears to be an inherent component of both male and female eroticism, only in rare instances has the established contemporary art system broached questions of a lesbian nature when discussing the meaning of "difference" or "otherness" and "gender," if not "sexuality."

For these reasons, the "Queer Show" is predictably unbalanced, with only a few works by lesbians. It is these I want to discuss. Martha Fleming and Lyne Laponte are represented by All Flesh is Grab. This is a hanging piece that echoes the sensuality of their installation at the New Museum's "Eat Me/Drink Me/Love Me." Working out of what seems to be the makeshift nature/culture field, this delicately framed, harp-like structure branches out as though reaching for a space that isn't there. Fixed at the center one finds a few stones wrapped in a transparent membrane-like an embryo waiting to be born.

Linda Matalon's rectangular vertical box with its compellingly black slit images an isolation and mysterious allure. Her evocative layering of wax-like shoeshine tones are beautiful, creating a subtle tension between the softness of the sculpture's skin and the piercing through of its body.

Marcia Salo's Victor/Victoria is by far the most sophisticated and exciting work in this show, and it is good technically. It is a revealing portrait because it is so archetypically awful, mingling as it does single shots and flashbacks. Victor/Victoria's commentary is on pseudo-mannish lesbian desire. As Salo points out, "female desire is contexted, psychologically, politically and linguistically." So this piece is about lesbian desire as a problem of identity and within the simulated space of patriarchal and heterosexist culture. I kept realizing, as I looked at it and enjoyed it, how sensitive, intelligent and eloquent it is about reclaiming oneself through breaking the taboos. Her imaginative use of a variety of configurations-cross-dressing, AIDS, ugliness and horror is terrifying. Like a shadow cast on a screen her photograph makes the lesbian a multiple personality reflecting all the complexity that careful attention to the label implies. Other works by lesbians included Eve Ashcraft, Carrie Yamaoka, Millie Wilson and Melissa Harris.

Most of the work by gay male artists struck me as slick, uneven, shallow, competent, shabby and melodramatic. But there were some sensitive and moving images. I was particularly touched by Robert Marshal with his poignant comment, "I have tried to analyze childish emotions and to discover what I meant when I declared myself to be a girl in a boy's body." He shows himself as cast off in a female environment in which his language tries to create a feasible space for his being. I also liked Hunter Reynold's witty and moving drag; fingers pressed to his lips bidding us to be as silent as the homophobic world would like us to be about who we are.

Wessel O'Connor's efforts to assert the right of gay and lesbian artists to a fair showing is commendable, and it appears to be a labor of love. But I couldn't help thinking that many of the stereotyped images of beef-cake, penises, ejaculations and the like did little to expand the audience's narrow definition of "Queer" art. I would like to think that the ability to recognize oneself, and others, primarily as human beings and to acknowledge the absoluteness of responsibility to each other would lead to a genuine recognition of large numbers of varieties within physical and sensuous facts. In any case, the "Queer Show" furnishes abundant evidence of the vitality of contemporary gay and lesbian art.

Ellen Banks, a painter familiar to the Boston area through her Boston Museum School teaching, showed her latest work in two simultaneous exhibitions in New York and Boston during October and November. Both exibitions testify to Banks's latest theme, which began in her work several years ago, abstract compositions based on musical scores. Her earlier work used Bach fugues and Chopin nocturnes as their inspiration, her most recent work interprets Brahms improvisations and Black spirituals. The main works are textured paintings of handmade paper glued to large-format canvases varying from 54"x 48" to 82"x 64", in glowing or somber colors.

In Boston, that musically pure city, all the works at the Akin Gallery are based on Brahms scores. They have an iconic presence intheir spare figuration and subdued grounds. The largest one, Improvisation: Opus 76 #2, cohtrasts the orange bars of the score with a heavily textured glowing scarlet background. A cooler version in pale silver and blue, Opus 119 #4, balances more equal areas of massive surface structure with a layered background in which several veils of color diversify the dominant tonality.

In New York, the scope of Banks's interests is shown by an equal division between spirituals and Brahms improvisations. They follow the same compositional format of linear pattern against a textured ground, but the color range of the spirituals appears to be more diverse and rich, and more representative of the mood of the music. One of the works is a series of eight small, handmade paper pieces representing measures of. Were You There? Here all shades of blues tinge the scarred paper, creating a somber and powerful piece.

The Brahms compositions are also very impressive. The improvisations of Opus 116 inspired three of the paintings which have unusual color range and combinations. The deep red vertical bars against a bronze textured background of Opus 116 #2 is a visual tour de force in which color and form, figure and ground, exist in creative tension.

There are three "Songbook" series at Soho 20 as well, each based on a spiritual and each entirely different in feeling from the deep, spacious blues of Roll, Jordan, Roll to the stark blacks, whites and grays of Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen.

Here is an artist whose rigorous geometry may recall Mondrian, but whose color often evokes Monet - incidently, her two artistic ideals.

TITLE: The Emporer's New Clothes: Censorship, Sexuality and the Body Politic

CONTENT:
That the body is a locus of political power struggle is not particularly newsworthy to women. However, we sometimes forget exactly how complex that struggle is.

Richard Bolton has used the current debates over artistic freedom, pornography and free speech to create an installation that explores how images of the human body are used for different ends.

It is the grossest sort of chauvinism to say that "The Emporer's New Clothes: Censorship, Sexuality and the Body Politic" is a thoughtful, intelligent show despite the fact that it is the work of a male artist. But I have to admit to some surprise that the exhibit was in fact so sensitive to feminist concerns. This no doubt partly results from the fact that many of his commentators were women, as were some of the photographers.

The core of the exhibit is a series of potentially controversial images drawn from three arenas: art, popular culture and pornography. Everything from Mapplethorpe to S&M spiked dog collars to perfume ads is fair game. Bolton circulated these images to national and local community and artistic leaders, people on every side of the debates about censorship and the body, and the majority of the exhibit is devoted to their written responses. Each color photocopy of an image is surrounded by half a dozen commentaries on it.

Also included in the show are the books and magazines from which these images were originally taken (to provide a cultural context that debates on censorship almost always lack, Bolton said) and a blank papered wall for visitors to pen their own comments on. Finally, painted on the back wall was a chronology of "some key events in the war on culture"-like the FBI's 1986 Library Awareness Program that asked librarians to spy on researchers - and the text of the eponymous tale.

There are two absolutely striking things about this show. One is how little the photographs really matter. That's a strong statement, because some of the images, like a woman with pins stuck through her nipples, are horrible. The second most striking aspect of the show is how absolutely postmodern it is -the sine qua non of multivocality - which is also one of the reasons that the show is valuable to feminist and to art criticism. Not only does it address in a thoughtful way the real tensions between photography and artistic expression, but it demonstrates the inner contradictions of postmodernism.

Feminists must, almost by definition, advocate a plurality of voices, a plurality that Bolton has certainly captured. But "The Emporer's New Clothes" shows the real danger both of privileging all voices (including those who seek to oppress us) and the dangers of being caught in the intoxicating pleasures of textual examination.

Bolton seems to be aware of these dangers, because in his version of the "Emporer's New Clothes"-painted in three long columns on one wall of the exhibit - the ending of the story has been changed. "He has nothing on!' the people shouted at last. The emporer shivered, for he was certain that they were right."

Rather than coming to his senses at last and learning to value his own judgment (which is what I remember the moral of the fable to be), the emporer simply decides to believe the crowd rather than the duplicitous tailors.

That's the message of this exhibit as well. Despite Bolton's efforts to create a participatory environment, we remain separated from both ourselves and from the subjects of the images. Bolton seems to suggest that constructions of sexuality are almost too complex to grasp. We see bodies - including our own-through an amalgam of images that includes everything from the sadistic to the consumerist to the sublimely erotic. This allows us to play a number of different, and often quite satisfying, roles.

But it means that we are always in the process of objectifying our bodies, of believing other people's stories about ourselves. Perhaps if the installation had been created by a woman, the moral would have been different. Perhaps she would have suggested that we could reclaim the right to de-objectify ourselves. Bolton has made a very convincing case for the opposition.

For many feminist artists, the problem of getting reviewed is not the art they do but the materials they choose to do it in. I once interviewed Lee Krasner, who explained to me as we were talking about abstraction in quilts that craft-art wasn't "high" art because it lacked the deep feelings, philosophic issues and aesthetic dimensions of painting. Most New York art critics writing for the trade slicks tend to follow Krasner's boundaries. They measure art from an elitist position that corresponds to that of the New York School, despite the inroads made by postmodernism.

Jane Kaufman is an artist who deviated from her roots, leaving behind the minimalism that brought her to art world attention in the 1970s, although traces of it are still evident in her current exhibition. As you enter the show you encounter two folding screens that evoke a Victorian bordello. The first is a curving mass of iridescent feathers and glass beads looking like a David Belasco production. The other, a foundation garment supporting a Ziegfeld-type showgirl, is encased in a blue mirror frame, encrusted with tacky amethyst glass and draped in clusters of ruby colored garnets. The format of these pieces embody Kaufman's feminist critique of woman as sex symbol, and her criticisms are as robust as Lillian Russell's perfomances in Hokey-Pokey (1912) at Weber and Fields' Music Hall.

Kaufman has a great sense of humor and it smiles through the other eight quilted pieces that make up the fabric collages on display. She has deliberately chosen to work in a medium that has traditionally been identified with woman's work. It is a significant political statement, since her quilted pieces document and celebrate women's lives and convictions. By learning the various stitches she connects with women over time and joins separate fragments together to symbolize the way woman's past and present has become a creative force - a force for social change.

It is no accident that one of the quilted collages is titled Some Things Are Black and White. The underlying support for it is as formal a grid as any New York minimalist could desire but there is nothing minimal about its content. The various kinds of marks: stripes, dots, zigzags, penguins, ostriches and other variations on the theme, become Foucault's pendulum, proving that design rather than motion is not fixed. Passsing behind the scenery, where formal concerns disappeared and where political considerations ironically emerge, one can't help laughing at the hand-painting and the refrain it sets up viz. "high art" and the act of burying one's head in the sand to escape from the "disagreeable" reality of racism. This wry ambiguity is central to grasping Kaufman's art. In works like her untitled hand-painted images and patch-work quilt from 1989, her Bon Appetit (1990) and an earlier work, Embroidered Crazy Quilt (1983-85), Kaufman maintains an uneasy relationship with an art historical past and present, suggesting the future lies elsewhere. Elsewhere, according to feminist theorist Teresa de Laurentis in Technologies of Gender (University of Indiana Press, 1987), is in the "... movement between the (represented), discursive space of the positions made available by hegemonic discourses (Krasner's aesthetics) and the space-off, that elsewhere, of those discourses; those other spaces both discursive and social that exist, since feminist practices (craft-art) have (re) constructed them, in the margins...."(p.26)

Linda Cunningham's stone gardens refer to the earth's geological structure, and at the same time allude to an elemental earthy continuity beneath the surface of an urban overlay. Located at two sites in lower Manhattan, on West Broadway at Franklin Street and at Chambers Street, these rocks and steel forms serve to remind us of the conflicted relationship between art and nature and between humans and their environment. In the literature of the sublime, as art historian Barbara Novak has reminded us, the desire to appropriate creation itself is primary.

Today, at a time when the planet is in acute danger, many contemporary artists are expressing a renewed concern with the landscape and its symbolic meaning. Geology, geography, natural history and philosophy have all become part of the current artistic vocabulary regardless of an artist's politics. Understanding that the past has become crucial for trying to comprehend the present, Cunningham's work explores the enigmas of creation. Her descriptive fidelity to the physical details and minute peculiarities of lava rock and the characteristic coloration of organically manifested minerals discloses the spiritual nature of not only nature, but ourselves as human beings. Billions of years of geological time express the fragility of unreplaceable natural resources.

Cunningham's steel and bronze materials, often salvaged from buildings that are being destroyed or those that have collapsed, represent the development of man-made hierarchies and binary oppositions, for example, nature vs. industry. The inequities, much like those between male and female, are expressive of a naive patriarchal thesis regarding Darwin's survival of the fittest. The nature/nurture dichotomy is part of Western philosophical thought and stems from 19th century notions that continue to influence contemporary thinking.

This is Cunningham's point, and her sculpture argues that this should no longer be a part of our thinking.

Art in public is like a museum without walls. Cunningham's sculptures invite viewers to interact with them. The participations is sometimes comic. Take for instance the brightly colored plastic box I found in a small crevice with a message for those curious enough to search for it. These stone and steel images express the unnatural confusion that one finds in the city. What the artist presents is a direct observation on a set of relationships in an urban society that are expressive of a new kind of alienation. Their importance lies in making us aware of what it means to be fully present in the world and in relationship to the mystery of all life, human and otherwise. They are about respecting ourselves and our environment. Looking at these objects one gradually becomes aware that Cunningham is proposing a different way of seeing which posits a new order, new kinds of human unity that transform the experience of urbanism.

Christina Schlesinger doesn't appropriate, use photographs or appear to indulge in postmodernisms. Unlike Madonna, she isn't a material girl. Eschewing the tendy, fashionable and obvious, she bases her painting on a system of creation that reaches back to the great hierarchical chain of being that tells us all things have life and do really live in some degree or measure. In this she shares an affinity with the visionary painters William Blake, Albert Pinkham Ryder and Marsden Hartley.

Schlesinger is a lover of nature, and her work encompasses an aesthetic of sensuality and intimacy that speaks to the deepest human emotions. On a more formal level she has a passion for Chinese ink painting and has spent time in China learning to capture the traditional spirit of brush, which she has translated into Western oil techniques. In Winter Strokes Schlesinger drags a heavily loaded brush across the canvas in thin, loose washes of subtle curdled grays. She uses the brush to shape movements and textures, conveying the landscape's underlying geometric structure and stressing its permanence and stability. In Edge of the Woods the pale lavender/blue rocks on the left contrast vividly with the champagne hues of the middle ground, forming an iridescent continuous web of sensuous brushstrokes.

Schlesinger's new work embodies matter and spirit as interchangeable, because thay are made up of the same substance and differ only as to mood and style. In landscapes like The Three Graces matter and spirit unite as two different aspects of the same energy. There is a constant undercurrent in the juxtaposition of the scattered broken limbs with the triad of rounded silvery birch trees that connects sensuality with nature. The forked crotches of Schlesinger's trees, i.e., Hunting Season are like truncated body parts; the knots of their trunks, surrounded by shaggy growths, resemble hair. Several of her fleshy branches intersect, connecting infinite zones of mottled space and pulsating with whimsical provocation.

The same sexually charged undercurrent blazes through her silver birches. Focusing on isolated groupings as in Three Graces, Schlesinger highlights elements such as peeling bark, broken trunks and splintered branches, giving them an anthropomorphic quality. In paintings like Shiloh and Antietam we know that some of these beings have lived, struggled and been transformed by their experiences. In these two pictures life and death become categories that collapse into one and another, reminding us that all things that arise from the earth return to the earth from which they come.

Cultivating her own garden, Schlesinger is a pure painter and a lyric colorist. In Birch Bodies her space reads like a Gauguin still life, her emphasis is on the physicality of paint while simultaneously stressing the two-dimensionality of the surface. Playing with spatial relationships and timeless subject matter she dares some striking viewpoints. The Long Goodbye joyously violates the sanctity of picture's frame with a continuously vibrating electric blue pattern of shimmering water set against the absolute stillness of two lone birches, one still upright and the other lying broken on the ground. Schlesinger's exhibition is a virtuouso performance that is remarkably successful and satisfying.

CONTENT:
In Honoré Daumier's time, a "femme d'esprit" was a woman endowed with keen intelligence and sharp wit. When, after 1835, political pressures became too great for Daumier's virul;ent caricatures of public figures to appear safely in Charivari, the Parisian satirical journal, he began to turn his attention to to these newly emergent "femmes d'esprit," the blue-stockings, socialist women and women writers, as safer targets. This exhibition displays 54 drawings, captioned by Charivari's editors and writers, mostly on the subject of women who were daring to express themselves in politics and writing. Daumier portrays them as ugly, stringy and shrill, cruel to their downtrodden husbands, neglectful of their children and households and prone to "collaborate" with male writers in more than their writing. The journal was staffed entirely by men for an audience of men who approved only of domesticated women.

There is also a selection of prints in which Daumier expresses his liberal sentiments by means of symbolic female figures of Peace, Liberty or The Republic. In contrast to the "femmes d'esprit" these women are physically and mentally strong, beautiful and powerful. They dress in classical Greek style and represent all that is noble and right in France. Numerous images in our public parks and older buildings still attest to our admiration for woman-as-symbol, with no individual identity or sign of any concrete achievement. It is interesting but not surprising to note that aristocratic Frenchmen of Daumier's time such as Condorcet and Saint-Simon supported intellectual and political women, whereas Proudhon and Daumier with their working-class backgrounds were opposed to women in any but domestic roles.

The extensive and scholarly catalog and the commentary accompanying the exhibition are singularly unjudgemental about material that, in my opinion, demands to be judged. The authors say that we should "reflect on the authority asserted by stereotypes and consider how in both Daumier's time and our own, representation often reinforces the ideology of one audience only at the expense of another." These images still have a large audience only too ready to have their anti-"femmes d'esprit" ideologies reenforced. Is the problem of discrimination against women in power or reaching for power so far solved that such a cool and academically impersonal context is appropriate for a display of virulent anti-"femmes d'esprit" drawings?

In the catalog introduction, Elizabeth Childs distances the reader with sentences like this one: "Our goal has been to examine Daumier's ambivalent- and from a contemporary viewpoint, often troubling-attitudes toward the women in his society as expressed in his satirical prints." I see nothing ambivalent in Daumier's attitude and find it not "often troubling" but always troubling to see images of women trying to participate in the larger society which hold them up to ridicule. In contrast, the book, Daumier - Lib Women, Bluestockings and Socialist Women, translated from the French and published by Leon Amiel, Inc. in 1974, has a preface by Francoise Parturier which takes a firm stand against Daumier's position. For example, on p. 6, "The period of the French Revolution with its great principles of liberty, saw men relentlessly excluding women from society with all the fervor of the Elders of the Church... in the Republic, too, women were to have neither the right to vote, nor to participate, nor to speak. They were to be pitilessly excluded from all the new-gound rights despite the fact that these were described as 'the inalienable rights of mankind.""

Daumier's drawings are undeniably powerful. I found the smiles and giggles of the audience at the exhibition disturbing, perhaps because I identify with the women whose images were being ridiculed.

A year ago, in these pages, I compared Sue Collier to Matisse and Bonnard. This show still relates to these artists in color and pattern, but a new element has entered that neither Frenchman ever exhibited: a psychological relationship between human figures on the canvases and between them and the viewer. The vibrant warm colors and strong patterns of the walls and the woman's dress in Reflections of a Woman invite a closer look. A young woman leans over a bathroom sink examining her face in the mirror above. Draped over the sink is a filmy garment, presumably in the process of being washed. We see the mirror-image. The intense and serious expression of the woman gives a double meaning to the word "reflection." Profound questions seem to be asked: "Who am I? Why am I here? What does my life mean?" This meditative, questioning attitude is repeated in a similar female figure in three other paintings. The man sitting with the woman in two works has a relaxed unquestioning expression. There is no conversation inferred, both figures are silent. In many of the works there are teacups on the table. The artist explained that at her mother's house tea was a constant. Memories of Mother shows a woman gripping a teacup under her chin with an iron fist, suggesting an iron will. All the paintings, with the exception of the black and white Five Men at a Table, are beautifully patterned and colored, showing the same concern with how light changes colors as was evident in her last show. The figures are simplified into planes of color; the anatomy is accurate and solidly modeled.

One large work, Peaceful in Bed, is mysterious. In a very large room with a steeply receding checked floor, a figure is huddled in a four-poster bed while a male figure approaches from the doorway. This work lacks the sense of technical resolution seen in the others. But here, too, one feels an impact similar to that made by a potent short story. A new narrative element has entered Collier's work that promises an interesting future.

CONTENT:
Katie Seiden's installation of sculpture dramatizes the different environments a-nd scale of each of four separate galleries. Conceiving of each disparate space as a distinct challenge, Seiden installs works differing i-n theme, mood and size to reflect her passionate concerns.

In the main gallery, big totemic works on Medusa bristle with anguish, defiance and venom. Using the Greek myth as a source, Seiden transposes the tortured spirit of Medusa (originally a matriarchal heroine before she was punished and changed into a hated and feared Gorgon) into an abstract, contemporary figure using footwear such as ice skates, boots and baby shoes encased in plaster and concrete. The "cutting edges" of at least 15 ice skates and many pointed wires seem to symbolize the sharp personality and forked tongues of Medusa. Two large horizontal mounded works filled with high-heeled shoes may be the stalactites and stalagmites filling Medusa's cave or the writhing inside of her head.

A sickly yellow lighting illuminates "The Recall Series," inspired by sensational headlines in the news media of today. 5These small narrative sculptures commemorate victims of violent crimes which often end in death. In The Wolfpack Recalls The Unnamed Central Park Jogger, a pair of bloody Saucony running shoes embedded in cement point upward, their tongues outstretched, bound by many laces. The base is covered with blaring headlines and news articles from The Daily News, The Post and The New York Times on the crime and trial. Other works in the series are Robert Chambers Recalls Jennifer Levin, Howard Beach Recalls Michael Griffith, and Jean Harris Recalls Dr. Tarnower.

Drawings in a third gallery relate in form to the upward spiraling shape of Seiden's Daphne and Apollo V sculpture centered in the middle of the room. In Ascent of The Grooms, small male figures extend out of circular forms of tar which seem to rocket out in space. Set against a background of shiny lead paint, a tree-like tar mass is encircled by small bits of green beach glass. The glass is drawn into the tar, entrapped here permanently as it may be on our polluted shores.

For nearly two years I've followed the Renaissance woman, Martha Clarke, as she has created a theater piece about environmental extinction. One element particularly piqued my fascination, that she would be incorporating the animals from St. Louis' Circus Flora in the production held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. St. Louis is where I live, and I had already reviewed that joyful, one-ring ensemble circus, entirely smitten with its dancerly choreography. Circus Flora had performed to highest acclaim at the Spoleto Arts Festival in South Carolina, where Martha Clarke had fed Flora the elephant and heard plenty from the circus' Artistic Director, Producer and CoFounder, Ivor David Balding, about efforts to prevent the African elephant from extinction.

I found Martha Clarke's effort extraordinarily beautiful and worthy. Her fresh images are still thoroughly etched on my brain, though I felt the strength of the piece involved my senses more than my heart.

The dim auditorium containing a large floor covered with wood chips and huge white double doors that occupy the rear of the set, projects a lonely, timeless mood. A high wire and a trapeze stretch above. Below and toward the front, an iron bedstead, a couple of plain wooden chairs, and a piano rest in the shadows.

"Endangered Species" employs a small cast, six four-legged and eleven two-legged creatures. Ms. Clarke wants us to see the polarities of this world, so she cast a dark horse and a white horse, black dancers and white dancers, naked bodies and clothed ones, men and women widely varied in age and size.

The drama meditates on and dances the basic elements of our universe, its wildness, the unstoppable rhythms of its natural world and the unquenchable polarities of the human essence: our intensely tender, introspective and generative possibilities, our unceasing need for violence, domination and destruction.

David Grausman performed the score, created by Richard Peaslee and Stanley Walden. Brutal sounds of war and terror involving machine guns, glass shattering and wild cats screeching punctuated the non-stop, fast-paced drama. Other distilled musical and dramatic moments included recordings of old opera excerpts and recitation of Walt Whitman's poetry, adapted by Robert Coe and spoken by Michael Anderson, Paul Guilfoyle, Peter McRobbie and Frank Raiter. Judy Kuhn gently sang melancholy old Broadway and Civil War tunes, as well as, with Courtney Earl, Pergolesi's "Stabat Mater." But the pounding of live horses' hooves, rounding the metaphorical circus of life, provided the rhythm which undergirded and integrated the performance.

Insistent hoofbeats augmented the dance as well. The horses' broad backs staged the dancers, Alistair Butler, Felix Blaska, Lisa Dalton and Valarie Henry, who had trained for months to learn balance while standing on a galloping horse. Dance movement was spare and powerful, like all of the elements in the dark, surreal piece.

Ms. Clarke magically transformed the very real, two-ton Flora into an archetypal elephant, an insubstantial essence who loped lightly and silently by, framed behind the huge white doors. A cloud of mist clung to Flora, an apotheosis of species endurance. Several times she appeared from behind the doors, once running, ears flapping, head and trunk up, tusks gleaming. Later, Flora slithered her trunk around to the knob, and pulled shut the'double doors, to say, her British trainer Gerald Balding later quipped, "That's quite enough for now. Goodnight!"

Though by the end of the first week of performances, Flora had gotten more favorable publicity than Baryshnikoff, "Endangered Species" was itself a casualty of lagging advance ticket sales and a terminal New York Times drama review and performed only half of its month-long schedule. Circus Flora opens at the Spoleteo Festival in May.

CONTENT:
Often described as the grand doyenne or high priestess of performance art, Rachel Rosenthal evoked awesome powers her own and those of Gaia - in Kala Institute's 8th Annual "Seeing Time" performance series.

Despite earthquake preparedness programs, Rosenthal nevertheless shook up the audience and revealed the infirmities of terra firma in a convincing enactment of the earth's creation, which erupted through her body and voice in thunderous sound and light. She also created enormous respect in this writer for the range and power of her means: communication and theatrical skills, informed passion, brilliant conceptualizing, and a nearly seamless integration.

Pangaean Dreams (subtitled A Shamanic Journey - and it certainly is!) takes its name from the intuited construct proposed in 1915 by Alfred Wegener, German lecturer in astronomy and meteorology, that some 250 million years ago the supercontinent, Pangaea (All Lands) broke up into land masses and began what he called "continental drift." Ridiculed at the time, his ideas are manifest now in the science of plate tectonics which has revolutionized geological understanding of the earth and its cycles. Multiple plates support the continents. The plates regenerate continuously through a system of ocean ridges where lava outpourings from under the sea create new crust. Heavier plates dive under lighter ones and return to the inner earth to melt again. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions on the earth's surface reflect the plate movements.

"Thus Gaia is constantly giving birth to and devouring herself in a circular dance," Rosenthal writes. "(Plate tectonics) emphasizes the transformative nature of the Earth. It illuminates the Gaia concept of a living cosmic body...." The "dreams" are shamanic journeys through the creation and life of the Earth, focusing time and again on the precariousness of humankind's current position in the geological continuum.

The "Gaia Hypothesis," called thus as it enters the fringes of scientific comprehension, proposes that the Earth is a living organism in which the totality reflects any changes anywhere in any part.

Personalizing the assault on the Earth through the metaphor of her own bodily decline, Rosenthal's opening entry is in a wheelchair, holding crutches. She invokes autibiography, history, science, mythology, philosophy, ecofeminism and angst to roar, growl, coax, charm, seduce and Joke herself and the audience through grand theatre of the politics, economics and sociology of near-terminal wounds to the Earth, inflicted by a humankind that fails to make connections. (In a previous work, Rachel's Brain, she questions whether the human brain might be one of nature's many mistakes, now moving slowly toward correction/extinction.

The integration of technical supports often made them equal performers with Rosenthal. Dain Olsen uses video and computer animation to render visual metaphors that parallel and illuminate the erupting of Pangaea that we observe in Rosenthal's body and voice. Lighting by Eileen Cooley seams over transitions and performs persona changes with Rosenthal as well as reinforcing text.

Composer-performer Leslie Lashinsky creates acoustic, electronic and vocal elaborations on the text using on-stage instruments and objects. Making Pangaea's eruptions as real as the 1988 quake, Lashinsky banged, punched and shook ceiling-to-floor thunder sheets of thin copper and steel while lights caught and flashed in their violent motion. Carrying slender 8-foot aluminum rods through visual fields, Lashinsky rubbed the rods with gloved hands to elicit high, ethereal singing of great beauty. She is also a bassoonist who performs with major orchestras in the Los Angeles area.

The child Rachel Rosenthal, born in Paris of Russian parents, came to the United States as a World War II refugee, already a veteran of performance within her familial environment. She studied art and theatre with Hans Hoffman, Merce Cunningham, Ervin Piscator and Jean-Louis Barrault. In California she created the Experimental Instant Theatre in 1956 and directed it for 14 years. A leader in the Los Angeles Women's Art Movement in the 1970s, she co-founded Woman Space- and found the impetus for her focus on performance art since 1975.

Writing in the Village Voice (Oct. 4, 1988), Alisa Solomon quotes Rosenthal on the influence she found in Artaud's writings as "so liberating at that time because he insisted that you could have an expression that used all artistic means in a seamless way." The next stage of liberation - from the male paradigm came through her awakening in the women's movement and her subsequent decision to focus her formidible resources on global issues. Rosenthal, Solomon says, "is the only performer to address (ecofeminist) issues with such astonishing emotion, as if every toxic drop is a personal affront. That's what sinks the claws of her work into your flesh...."

Rosenthal's performance history is wide-ranging and distinguished. In a New Art Examiner (Oct., 1987) review of her DOCUMENTA performance of Rachel's Brain, Maureen Sherlock speaks of "an exciting redefinition of the possibliities of performance." Lawrence Enscoe, in the Los Angeles Daily News (Sept. 17, 1990) describes the sold-out performances of Pangaean Dreams as "the watershed event of the Los Angles Festival," adding "[S]he infuses it with a mesmerizing sense of theatrics. [I]t's the theatre of Rosenthal's own body and voice-lithely snapping, twisting and playing out in the flesh the trauma of a volatile Gaia, Mother Earth, and her violent, drifting human community."

Recently Rosenthal refused a grant of $11,250 from the National Endowment for the Arts because she could not sign her name to "that piece of obscenity." She places the issue in the context of previous experience with totalitarian harrassment and persecution of artists.

The past, with its aura of self-discovery, always holds a special fascination. How and why an event took place, why it happened at a certain time, what circumstances led up to it and what its repercussions were. What we would have done given the same situation. Art, and the process of creation, also has the same magical lure-what inspired the artist and where the roots of that inspiration lie, how it relates to what came after it or what other works it inspired. In dance, particularly, where there is no concrete canvas before you, no set theatre script to go by, but only the "hearesay" of words reported after the event, the reconstruction of a choreographer's work is tantamountly important, because it gives you a glimpse of what the work could have looked like if you had been present when it was originally done. Given the ephemeral nature of the art form itself, it can never really be more than a suggestion of the past, since sparse notes and the vagaries of memory of those involved are never completely enough to reproduce a work in situ, let alone years later when the choreographer is no longer alive to make her own corrections. The transitory nature of dance always multiplies the problems of reconstruction. Even with video and film documentation, the question remains of what is happening off-camera during the lovely moments of close-up when a dancer's expressive face is busy emoting the necessary tour de force mood. How is the body moving, or is it moving at all?

So it's something short of miraculous when a company takes on the task of reconstruction, particularly for more than one work, as in the case of Momenta at the Academy of Movement and Music. Artistic director Stephanie Clemens has taken on the chore of reinstating modern dance pioneer Doris Humphrey to her rightful place as one of the most important early choreographers. Her revolutionary dance technique, based on the fall and recovery theory, is lyrical, dramatic and exhilerating to watch. Although the students from the Academy that primarily make up Momenta haven't begun to master this technique yet, they can still offer us interesting insights of what Humphrey's work was like, particularly her early dances. Seeing these and the works of other early modern dance pioneers such as Humphrey's teacher, Ruth St. Denis, points out common roots and influences. Stylistic differences between the legendary modern dance creators begin to lessen as similarities become more apparent.

In a floor exercise demonstration St. Denis put together circa 1915, called "Under the Leaves," buried in all the lyrical poses are some macho arm muscle flexing that is reminiscent of the work her husband and his Men Dancers did. In "Soaring," a work she and Humphrey choreographed jointly in 1920, the viewer's spirit is lifted with the billowing folds of a parachute manipulated by five dancers, usually with four at each comer and one standing below its huge arched dome, or on top of it in the center to reverse its course and form a lovely giant flower. Many of the early modern dance choreographers used banners, scarves or lengths of cloth that they waved about in various ingenious ways and patterns, but here the craft reaches an apogee. Even in the small Oak Park studio, the effect is staggeringly beautiful. Set in the open as it originally was with a real wind fluttering its edges, it must have been an incredible spectacle to behold.

Before going to study with St. Denis, Humphrey took classes at Mary Wood Hinman's school in Oak Park. Breathing life into works found in the notebooks of Hinman, Clemens has newly reconstructed her most recent discoveries, Humphrey's "Three Dances." All three feature children from the Academy, dressed like Isadorables (the name Isadora Duncan's students came to be known by) in short chiffon tunics, flower wreaths in their long tresses. The dancers are the epitome of natural grace in their hops, skips and poses, playfully and prettily cavorting thtough the program.

Also on the program were five of St. Denis's Orientalia, quick snippets of dances with a different, spectacularly exotic costume in each, most often East Indian. Humphrey's stately 1928 masterpiece to Bach's music, "Air For G String," was another presentation.

Religious devotees often express their feelings in elaborate spectacles, from the processions of the Christian church to the seasonal dances of the American Indians. In India, where everything is regularly codified, dedicated temple dancers (devadasis) perform to their deities in temple ceremonies. These devotional dances often focus on the lore of the Hindu pantheon. The dances' combined elements of sensuousness and devotion create a uniquely dynamic spirituality.

Bharata-natya, one of the oldest styles of classical Indian dance, is a continuous spectacle. The graceful, statuesque poses give it an air of architectural grandeur. The costumes, always of rich silk and laden with gold trim, emphasize the dancers' physical attributes. Golden jewelry glitters with a profusion of gems. Flowers bedeck the dancers' heads and their long trailing braids. Their bare feet and palms are painted red, and heavy make-up enhances their facial beauty. Bells around ankles add an emphatic echo to the hard-hitting stamping of feet, and the eyes and hands offer a mimetic language that completes the effect of pomp and circumstance. The musicians, often seated at the side of the stage, simultaneously sing or sound out rhythmic syllables that the dancers translate into steps.

Westerners don't normally see the pageantry of the temple dances more often, a single dancer performs a series of solos that only suggest the full splendor of the original. Even in solo performances, however, especially by consummate artists like the celebrated Hema Rajagopalan, a sense for the detail of the ceremonial spectacle comes across. But when the number of performers is multiplied, we can actually visualize the scope of the original. While one elaborate costume may wow the viewer, a row of them in an array of vivid, shimmering hues can leave us in stunned deligh

Rajagopalan, who heads an Indian dance academy, Natyakalalayam, presented just such a spectacle, the dance drama Dasavatara-with a cast of over 50-as a benefit for the Chinmaya Mission Chicago. She herself played in the orchestra, also chanting the rhythmic vocalization. Suseela Ramaswany sang and composed the music with T.S. Sankaran, who played flute. M.R. Ganeshan was the percussionist. Choreographed by Hema Raiagopalan with the assistance of her daughter Krithika, the epic work was capably rendered.

With this many dancers, one expects uneven dancing. Some performers were quite talented. As the demon in Varaha(Boar), Gowri Ramnath, with her darting wild eyes, was particularly convincing. In Vamana (Young Sage, Divya Sunder as Vamana showed a studied seriousness appropriate to the role. Arti Subramaniam as Krishna brought a fierce intensity to her dancing in both Narisimha (Half Lion, Half Man) and Krishna. Chaya Rangarai as Sita in Rama danced with an exceptional fluidity. Vidya Kurella as Vishnu and Usha Tadikonda as Laksmi in the opening section, Matsya (Fish), lolled regally. This exotic opening followed on the heels of the Invocation Dance; obeisance to the godhead at the beginning of each bharata-natya performance is but one reminder of the religious nature of classical Indian dance.

The complex story line is another (this performance lasted nearly four hours). Essentially, when there's a decline in religious practice, Vishnu descends, in 10 manifestations, to correct the situation. The somewhat Darwinian progression begins with an avataram (incarnation) as a fish: Brahma the creator goes to sleep during the dissolution of the universe, and the Vedas slip out of his mouth. After a demon hides them in the ocean, Vishnu becomes a fish, kills the demon, and restores the scriptures to the world. In Vishnu's final incarnation, after many adventures, he becomes Kalki, the horse-faced one, and destroys the world because of the intolerable evil in it.

The choreography too is sometimes sparse and practical. Often characters enter or exit with a simple chain of little hopping steps that get them about quickly and efficiently. The posed and posturing dancing has all the characteristic features of classical Indian dance, but there's nothing overly fancy, nothing like the virtuosic speed to make you sit up and take note, nothing like the way Rajagopalan herself would have danced it. Yet the pageantry, moment by moment, takes over and carries the work. Spectacle isn't created for star performers, but for the cumulative effect on the viewer. As Swami Chinmayanda is quoted in the program as saying, "It is vain to waste one's time considering which God to worship. Worship Him in any form. It is the sincerity of devotion that matters." And there was no lack of fervor in this particular form of worship.

The first presentation was by the new director of the National Academy of Design, Edward P. Gallagher, who thanked Barbara S. Krulik, interim director and who has been named to the new post of deputy director for her work on the show. He went on to acknowledge the importance of the exhibition and the Academy's pride in hosting it.

Gallagher was followed by Edward Sullivan, who raised some very serious questions concerning the monumentality of the task of representing the culture of Mexico, much less the art by women in Mexico. He then commented on his approach to this subject, asking why a "white gringo" was doing this and if such a person can be sensitive to the issues. He hoped he had been, while acknowledging that a male feminist cannot hope to deal with the same subjects in the same way that a female feminist might. Sullivan spoke of the "colonization of women's art" and of how both Latin Americans and North Americans had been deprived of exposure to the enormous impact of women on Mexican culture. He also mentioned the many other exhibitions going on all over New York.

Jean Franko discussed gender and representation in Mexico citing Maria Scargo and Frida Kahlo as examples of sexually liberated women, criticizing the Metropolitan Museum for its concept of the "sleep" of Mexican culture and pointing out that when Spain conquered Mexico there were negotiations and hybridizations that are still visible in Mexican art and life. All of which enrich the culture. Franko also pointed out that the Aztecs were conquers too. Women, she explained, were active agents of hybridization, citing examples like the Virgin of Gaudalupe. She concluded her talk with an overview of political movements in Mexico during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, suggesting that now it is the strong women who are toting the machos along.

Sarah Lowe spoke about Tina Modotti's communism and how it helped to shape a vision of Mexican nationalism by providing revolutionary icons. Ironically, Modotti was deported by the revolutionary government. Hayden Herrera spoke about Kahlo as a cult figure, mentioning Madonna's admiration for her as a wild and sexy vamp, the film producers interested in her life, her bisexuality and obsessive relationship with Rivera, and the fashion industry's targeting of her style as a hot property. Herrera was very pointed in her criticism of all this media exploitation of Kahlo and her work. Mary-Anne Martin then presented an overview of the market for Frida's work, citing such record prices as Diego and I, the first Latin American painting to break the $1,000,000 price barrier. She also noted the Mary-Anne Martin Fine Arts' purchase of Two Nudes in a Jungle while at the same time discounting any lesbian connotations attached to the painting (a point to which I will return shortly).

Martin was followed by Janet Kaplan, who spoke on Varo, commenting on her Catholicism and how it figures in her work, and mentioning the distinct outsider position Varo held as a Spanish woman in a Mexican society. The final speaker, Elena Climent, gave a very touching autobiographical talk on the development of her art and the meaning of its urban imagery. She spoke of the nostalgia she grew up with and the purist folk aesthetics that dominated the older generation of Mexican artists. She described the pain this caused her and the incredibly difficult struggle she had finding an imagery of her own that was expressive of her generation and embodied its concerns. Climent then showed slides of her work, discussing the uniqueness of her experience in Mexico City and the significance of the nontraditional subjects she chose to paint. She noted how the more things change the more they remain the same, citing the persistence of altars as one aspect of an unbroken continuum.

The question and answer session was somewhat diminished by the absence of both Herrera and Martin, who had other commitments to rush off to (I wish people wouldn't accept honorariums when they don't have the time to fully earn them.) We were all deprived of what might have been a stimulating discussion because neither of these women stuck around for the fireworks. Both had raised questions about sexual freedom and gender, and both seemed to want to avoid discussing Kahlo's lesbianism. This seemed strange given the title of the symposium, which very clearly focused on issues of gender. When the question was raised, all of the panelists were apparently struck dumb. Finally curator Edward Sullivan offered to comment on Frida's sexual orientation-her love for women and her influence on gay males in Latin America. He was very direct, pulled no punches and dealt with difference as a natural course of scholarship. He was refreshingly honest and informative.

Once Sullivan opened the discussion, Jean Franko ventured forth, saying that sexuality in the 1930s and 40s in Mexico was a coded system of values that one had to look for because of several factors, including religion and politics. I couldn't help feeling sad that with all the work the women's movement has done, female feminists still feel awkward dealing with women's love for other women. The word lesbian seems to terrify them, and they seem uncomfortable according the lesbian space in women's studies in the history of art. Let's hope we can do better next time around.

TYPE: PANEL
CONTENT:
The panel, like the exhibition of the same name at the Whitney extension where it was held, was to "investigate the role of small-scale painterly abstraction in American art from 1940 to 1965" and to determine whether the "lesser-known artists have been overlooked because they worked exclusively in small formats."

Jeffrey Wechsler opened by explaining that the current exhibition was a reduced version of the original show that had traveled to several venues. As for the title concept, he said, "Ordinarily one thinks of vast canvases as representative of Ab Ex; this exhibition is the other side. Many of the Ab Ex artists, including Pollock, made paintings less than 36 inches -the major painters worked at times in small scale- and some lesser-known worked only in small-scale."

Irving Sandler called it a revisionist show that has revised accepted notions of Ab Ex. "The achievements of Pollock and Rothko may have been because of large scale. [A]rtists who worked small may have wanted to induce intimacy [but] size was important. Still, Rothko and Newman evoked sublime and exalted images, creating a sense of vastness [T]hey achieved vision with color alone-color is at its best when used in large areas. Pollock's bodily inventions forced him to work in large scale. Big pictures offered challenges; large canvases replaced French painting. The great image of Ab Ex is the size of the brush-house-painter's size. There was also then an appetite for large paintings."

Dore Ashton said that scale differed from size-5' x 5' was really not so large-and that she saw many small-scale paintings at the Tanager Gallery in the early 50s. Wechsler believes that the perception, "Ab Ex is large paintings," has become the reality, so that museums perceiving the paintings of the period as large, only show their large ones, although they may own smaller ones, too. Sandler said the label Ab Ex is a confusing one.

Charles Seliger, the only artist on the panel, appeared to be present only to talk about himself, and, given the opportunity, to complain of the scant attention he's received in his lifetime. (His works are small). Sandler comforted him by saying "there was a taste for the large picture."

Opening the floor to the audience, Sandler fielded the first question from someone who expressed the desire "to understand quality." Sandler said he bases judgements on his "own perception." He "looks as hard as he can, sees a lot and responds." As to why there were only 15 artists in his book, "There were other artists, but I chose those 15 for their attitudes towards their own group." Wechsler threw in, "small-scale painters were quiet, non-aggressive types."

At this point there began a series of scatter-shot questions and statements largely from women in the audience such as: "How viable is Ab Ex at this moment?"; "Susan Rothenberg, Elizabeth Murray, Freya Hansel all have the same impulse"; "Ann Gibson is working on a book on women of Ab Ex"; "What happened to the women of Ab Ex?" In an attempt to mollify this outburst, Ashton cited the Pollock/Krasner show, saying "she wasn't neglected; Krasner was the inferior painter. [A]nother woman, Sonia Sekula, had a breakdown." Throwing a crumb, Ashton finished with, "I was married to an artist who was ignored."

In sum, Wechsler argues that small is important and neglected, presumably to the benefit of his own career. Who else has come up with anything new about Ab Ex lately?

Irving Sandler dismisses the concept, but then his investment is in the large works, subject of his several books. His "arguments"-brush size, color and "Ab Ex is large paintings" are not necessarily persuasive -perhaps just a restatement of belief. In this context, a quote from Rothko comes to mind: "To paint a small picture is to place yourself outside your experience. . . . However you paint the larger picture you are in it." This, however doesn't explain anything beyond the obvious. Yes, bigger really is, uh, bigger.

Note: The exhibition, "Abstract Expressioism: Other Dimensions," included the works of Lee Krasner, Ethel Schwabacher, Sonia Sekula, Janet Sobel and 23 male artists. Two or more works were shown for 13 of the men and for one woman (Lee Krasner); all otheres were represented by a single small work.

CONTENT:
Bethe Morisot, one of Impressionism's founding members, brought a dedicated painter's skill, a fresh and daring vision, and, not least, a woman's viewpoint to her art. Although, according to high priest of Impressionist scholars John Rewald, she was the founder whose work remained most faithful to the movement's initial concepts, her work was for many years undervalued in the same manner as that of Mary Cassatt, both artists circumscribed as "merely" painters of women and children. However, interest in Morisot has increased since the centennial celebration of her birth in 1941 and the publication of selected correspondence in 1957. The 1987 retrospective at the National Gallery in Washington and its beautifully illustrated catalog by Charles F. Stuckey and William P. Scott reawakened appreciation of the high quality of this artist, who was in the forefront of a revolution. Anne Higonnet's honest and perceptive biography, drawing on previously unpublished journals and correspondence, adds much to our knowledge and understanding of Morisot.

Needless to say, Morisot's accomplishments were not achieved without difficulties. Despite a loving family, supportive husband, intellectually stimulating friends and, for most of her life, a lack of financial worries, Morisot had her frustrations. She had to struggle against prevailing attitudes and customs intended to "protect" women. Obviously, she could not sit up nights in cafés discussing art nor attempt the frank subject matter of a Degas. Moreover, Morisot was pressured throughout her twenties to marry, and like any modem woman agonized over the question of whether marriage and motherhood could be combined with a career. (She had good reason to contemplate this, since her sister Edma had abandoned art upon her marriage. Morisot finally married Eugene Manet at age 33 and gave birth to her beloved daughter Julie at age 37.) She endured not only the rejections and contempt directed at the rebel Impressionist group, but also the accusations of "unwomanly" behavior aimed at women artists.

On the other hand, Morispt was fortunate to come of age when professional art training was becoming available to upper-middle-class women. Higonnet describes Berthe and Edma's early studies and the sisters' growing interest in art as a serious pursuit. Landscape lessons with Corot and sketching trips to the Louvre galleries (chaperoned by their mother) led to acquaintances with other artists, young men they would not otherwise have encountered. Initially attracted to Morisot by her charm and potential as a model-Eduouard Manet, for example, painted her many times-her colleagues came to respect her for her seriousness of purpose, diligence, originality and talent. Eventually she was known as a "painter's painter."

A good biography of a woman artist should help the reader comprehend the personal and social forces that shape her career. This is a good biography. We come to know the conflicts, enthusiasms and doubts of this intense, hard-working artist who was also a kind, gracious and loving woman. Not only the artist, but also her family and friends come to life in readable prose, yet Higonnet does not neglect relevant facts about the world these people inhabited and its effect upon their lives and work. Quotations are skillfully interwoven for emphasis and evidence. Higonnet admires Morisot, a woman who "negotiated a narrow but almost uncannily astute path between the demands of society and those of art."

The book has a few black and white illustrations, hardly adequate. For color and detail, go to the Stuckey/Scott catalog, which reveals Morisot's artistic range as, ever growing and developing, she tried different mediums and experiments. Though, like most of the Impressionists, her subject matter consisted largely of landscapes, portraits and genre, her variations within these parameters are numerous and her skills admirably suited to her subjects. With hindsight, we can see clearly how Morisot skirted the very edges of Abstract Expressionism with her fluid coloristic shorthand.

Morisot, truly an avant garde artist, is again recognized for her role in the history of modern art. She also, says Higonnet, "takes a central place in the history of women artists, a history she could not foresee because she was so much one of its pioneers."

CONTENT:
I am presently reviewing this book through a xerox of the real thing, kindly provided me by the public relations officer of the NAD, Howard L. Moore. The $110 catalog is a disturbing demonstration of how little sensitivity toward the viewer's pocketbook its producers had. This is hardly a cure-all for neglected women artists. I cannot comment on the color plates, nor can I tell you much about the quality of the production itself; I can only tell you that it has essays by Edward Sullivan and Linda Nochlin in English and Spanish - a plus in our multiracial climate. Nochlin states that her first encounter with "a Mexican woman artist" was more than twenty years ago. She then relates that artist was Remedios Varo, who isn't Mexican. She later discovered Frida Kahlo and others. What her highly intelligent essay highlights is how much we have to learn about Mexico and the art its women made. I say this because ignorance concerning Latin America is rampant among North American scholars. Nochlin's essay emphasizes the need for a major reevaluation of the supposedly universal standards and values we use to judge art. In the final analysis one has to wonder why an essay titled "Mexican Women Artists" isn't about Mexican women.

Sullivan's essay, what I can read of it due to the poor quality of my xerox, appears to be an extensive overview of the framework of the show, the conditions under which women in Mexico produced art, and the position of women in Mexican culture. He gives an extended postmodern reading of the impact of Frida Kahlo's work on gay male artists such as Nahum Zenil and Julio Galan (included in the Americas Society show at 680 Park Avenue at 68th St). He suggets that Kahlo's influence allowed them to come to a greater realization of their own emotional goals. During the symposium discussion, Sullivan mentioned that he did not know of any women artists, gay or otherwise, who had been influenced by Frida Kahlo. I can certainly think of one, Quimetta Perle, and I am sure there are others he'd like to know about. Frida has become a cult figure among lesbian artists.

TITLE: Crafts in the Art Marketplace

CONTENT:
It is an irony that the US crafts arena of the visual arts is dominated by white males, yet it lags behind painting and sculpture by conventional measurable standards such as status; supporting disciplines such as theory, history, curatorial positions and development; grant opportunities and awards; number and significance of exhibitions; and marketing and gallery representation opportunities. The above occur in frequencies ranging from nonexistent to insufficient, and the primary reason is unquestionably related to gender: crafts are historically linked to domesticity and women and are therefore situated lower in the arts hierarchy than painting and sculpture. The most predictable result is that artists working in crafts media earn considerably less for their work than similarly established artists working in the "fine arts" arena.

"This can be demonstrated by comparing selling prices of ceramics and glass, the most established and highest priced of crafts media, to selling prices of fine arts at recent auctions. In February, 1989 the US crafts world was delighted to be included for the first time in an auction sponsored by a major international art dealer. Christie's (New York) held a sale of contemporary ceramics and glass, and at last crafts marketers were able to assure crafts collectors that a secondary market for their acquisitions exists. This is is an important component for purchasers who are buying with investment value in mind, for the obvious reason that in order to reap the benefits of an improving market there must be a structure in place for reselling work, i.e., a mechanism to allow profit-taking. Also, both buyers and sellers of clay and glass knew that high auction sale prices received for paintings and sculptures and the resulting publicity of those sales had been a driving force in escalating prices for those oeuvres over the last decade.

From the flurry of auctions in late1989 and early 1990 that included clay and glass, one can point to numerous disparities in market value between "art" and "craft." For instance, Dale Chihuly, who is the most prominent glass artist in the United States and arguably in the world, did not command a selling price higher than $12,000. He is in every major contemporary glass collection; indeed it would be impossible to take seriously a collection of contemporary glass that does not contain at least one piece by Chihuly, yet $12,000.00 was the top auction price for his glass. Of course, he is still a fairly young man of fifty and this could be the reason that his work did not achieve financial heights, and it should be noted that his work has sold in galleries for up to $30,000. Another master is Peter Voulkos, often acknowledged as the most important ceramist of the 20th century. It was he who first interpreted Abstract Expressionism in clay and who was the leader of the West Coast clay movement of the 50s and 60s. His Snake River of 1959, priced at $50,000-$70,000, brought $55,000 at the February 23, 1990 auction of "Contemporary Art including Prints, Ceramics and Glass." In the same auction Alphabet, a small 1959 painting by Jasper Johns sold for $572,000; it had been expected to bring $300,000-$350,000. I admit that two sales from one auction are hardly overwhelming evidence of discrimination against crafts in the marketplace, but such ratios are typical. I also admit the difficulty of making comparisons between artists and between prices for their work. Are Peter Voulkos and Jasper Johns appropriately juxtaposed? How can I defend that juxtaposition when there is no Venice Biennale for crafts where Peter Voulkos might have exhibited, when there are few museums which seriously collect contemporary crafts, when there are few craft historians to document Voulkos' significance in the long history of ceramics and no history or theory of contemporary crafts media currently being taught in US colleges?

I defend such a comparison as I might defend the comparable worth of a registered nurse and a foreperson, an office clerk and a laborer, in the knowledge that gender hierarchy created and perpetuates our culture's belief that painting and sculpture, which often have little remaining attachment to daily life, are more valuable spiritually, intellectually and financially than creative endeavors that have historical ties to function and ritual, ties which link them to women.

By using examples of a white man as a painter, a glass artist, and a ceramist I do not wish to detract from the accomplishments of women and minorities in these media nor overlook the excellent work done in other crafts media not included in the auctions. Both clay and glass are fields which in the United States are predominantly male, overwhelmingly white and "star" oriented. Therman Statom and James Tanner are among the few black stars in glass and clay, and it is telling that their work was not included in any of the auction catalogues I consulted. Most of the stars are white men, though a notable exception whose work was in two auctions is Ginny Ruffner, a hotly collected glass artist whose work is in most major contemporary glass collections. Ruffner has shown her work intemationally, she has been featured in Absolut Vodka advertisements (as were Andy Warhol and Frank Stella), and she has been the subject of numerous published articles. Her painted lampglass sculpture Armchair Architect, of 1989 sold for $4,000 at a March, 1990 New York auction. One month earlier Cindy Sherman's Untitled, of 1987, a color photograph, sold for $12,100 at Christie's. Of course Cindy Sherman faces obstacles both as a female and as an artist working in photography, an arena that was not initially embraced by fine art.

The point is not to pit Peter Voulkos against Jasper Johns nor Ginny Ruffner against Cindy Sherman. That is the opposite of the point,.and I use the examples only to show that our culture's bottom line, money, reflects the low status of crafts and to predict that this will not change so long as the status and value of women and minorities is unequal to the status and value of white men.
