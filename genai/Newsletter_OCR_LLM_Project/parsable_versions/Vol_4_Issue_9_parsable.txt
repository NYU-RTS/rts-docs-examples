Monday, Jan. 29, 1979: Signs, buttons, delegates... The day-long convention of the Coalition of Women's Art Organizations opened at the Embassy Row Hotel in Washington, DC. Upon registering, all delegates (representing organizations or attending as individuals) received a packet with the jam-packed program for the day, political information (how to talk to one's legislator, how a bill becomes law), booklets on arts legislation and the status of women in art, a statement of CWAO goals for the coming year, and documentation of CWAO activities since last January's convention.

CWAO president Joyce Aiken opened the meeting promptly at 9 a.m., welcoming the approximately 200 delegates who packed the hall and formally introducing CWAO officers. Speakers included Gail Rasmussen, executive director, and Bella Schwartz, president, of Artists' Equity Association, DC chapter. Both stressed the need for artists to be involved in government. (CWAO has been working with Artists' Equity on such issues as the Art Bank Bill.)

Next, representatives voted to accept a position statement presented by Ruth Weisberg, CWAO Vice-President for Programs and Goals. This included proposals for a federal agency arts access directory, actions in art education against the monopoly of Janson and Gardner textbooks, and formation of a national network to influence legislation directly.

Then, evoking the spirit of Houston, La Verne M. Love, Women's Coordinator, Smithsonian Institution, asked us to join hands in a prayer for sisterhood. Love stressed the importance of reaching out to include more minority women.

Ellouise Schoettler, CWAO Executive Director, presented a legislative report referring, among other things, to the vicissitudes of the White House Conference on the Arts, which may now be held in 1980 if funds are appropriated. A spirited discussion followed her reading of a resolution in support of the Art Bank Bill, raising the issues of equitable representation for women and minorities, as well as the need for contracts to protect the rights of artists whose works might be purchased. As currently written, the legislation includes a deaccession policy that has upset many artists. The resolution was tabled for further discussion.

Proceeding promptly in the crowded agenda, Louise Weiner from the Dept. of Commerce discussed a time-motion study on culture being conducted by her department. She spoke also of ways Commerce can work with artists' groups for mutual goals.

Next was Judith Brodsky, who, with a stirring tribute to his accomplishments, introduced one of the key speakers of the morning, Senator Harrison A. Williams of her home state of New Jersey. Williams has been an active supporter of the arts in Congress for 20 years and is a sponsor of the Art Bank Bill. He emphasized that we as artists must communicate ideas not only through our works, but with our voices to the legislature. He spoke glowingly of the potential of the Art Bank-both for those who produce art and those who will be inspired by art in the workplace.

Closing the morning program, Mayor Marion Barry of the District of Columbia described his plans to incorporate art into city agencies. These include rotating exhibits by local artists in the mayor's office and setting up an arts advisory board. According to Mayor Barry, "We gauge our cities by their art and artists," and these are often key tourist attractions.

Adjourning to the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill, delegates lunched with women working in the State Department and in other Washington institutions. Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), who might be described as a "converted feminist" on art issues, read the depressing statistics he had presented to a congressional committee, which detailed the minuscule representation of women on grant panels and in national collections. (Women at my table from the personnel of the department National Gallery of Art removed their identity badges in embarrassment at these statistics.)

The floor was then taken by June Wayne, our eloquent principal speaker. She came to Washington first in 1939 to protest dismissals of artists from the WPA project. Describing the success of that initial artists' contingent, Wayne reiterated the need for adequate statistics on the number of women in public collections, noting that all museums receive public funds. She discussed other issues, including the inequity of tax laws for artists, the limited number of grants given to women artists, and her ambivalence about the Art Bank Bill (deaccession being her major objection). Inspired by this message, delegates then went to plead the case of women artists directly with their legislators. For many it was a first experience of political lobbying.

At a debriefing meeting and wine-and-cheese party later, participants were generally enthusiastic about their afternoon. Most had been able to speak directly with members of Congress or their staffs. The flush of excitement was on the faces of all I spoke with, and they were optimistic about our issues. (On a more realistic note, I am sure that our initial contact in Washington is only the beginning of many such actions.)

In conclusion: It was an impressive day of hard work, well planned. My only regret is that more artists could not afford the trip, and I hope that future CWAO national events can be organized to include the voices of more artists.

Other notes: On Tuesday, at the panel "Folk Art and Neo-Folk Art," Pat Ferrero showed slides of a former art instructor of mine, Grace Earl, from Carnegie-Mellon U., my special favorite during her one brief semester. I had so few women instructors in my university days that I was delighted to find Earl once again. She lives now in a small apartment in San Francisco, where she creates fantastic quilts.

The ceremony for "Outstanding Achievement in the Visual Arts" brought tears to my eyes as I watched my dear friend and mentor Isabel Bishop receive an award. Along with most others in the room, I was overwhelmed by the presence of these distinguished women, each with her own personality Louise Nevelson with inch-long eyelashes; Alice Neel, crying from the lights or the moment; the formidable Selma Burke. (O'Keeffe sent a brief telegram.) I loved seeing each artist being herself and presenting yet another perspective as role model. At the exhibition of the artists' work that opened at the Middendorf Lane gallery after the ceremony, numbers of women-some shy, some bold couldn't resist asking for an autograph or to have their picture taken with one of the artists. Isabel Bishop found herself placed in front of her portrait by Alice Neel and was surrounded by admirers.

At Wednesday's "Performance and Events" panel, I was especially impressed by Suzanne Lacy's frank discussion of use of the media. This was the first time I had heard an artist describe publicly how she had organized an event so that no matter how it was picked up by media her message (in this case, on rape) would get through. More artists should talk about how they gain publicity for shows and events.

During the week I met women I had known only by name or through correspondence; others were old friends from a year ago. Home now, tired, back at school and studio, I think of next year. WCA says it may take art and politics to New Orleans.

"If there's anything I'm certain of at this moment, it's that ornament and decoration have become dead arts in the west." Clement Greenberg, Art International, January 1975

That quotation, batting around in my files for four years, came to mind on the auspicious occasion of "Decoration Day" in Soho last month. Whether Greenberg was thinking primarily of something like the squiggles stamped by General Electric onto refrigerator doors to "ornament" or "decorate' them, or whether he had the fine arts sector in mind, is not clear. Either way, he should have read his Wölfflin. In Principles of Art History (1932) Wölfflin said, "The history of art is not secondarily but absolutely primarily a history of decoration."

For Greenberg, and anyone else who may have missed it, here's a rundown on the first of two recent panels about modern art that declares itself, first and foremost, decoration:

'Interior (and Exterior) Decoration'
ATOA panel, Jan. 26
Robert Jensen, mod.; Valerie Jaudon, Ned Smyth, Robert Kushner, Joyce Kozloff, Scott Burton, Miriam Schapiro, Arlene Slavin, speakers.

There was an air of Old Home Week at the "Interior (and Exterior) Decoration" panel Jan. 26. When a man in the audience called out to Joyce Kozloff, "Louder-we can't hear you!" everyone laughed, because they knew it was her husband Max. Miriam Schapiro's husband, Paul Brach, also made some fine points from the sidelines, including the fact that in ancient Greece the artist who carved the capital of a column received exactly the same wage as the one who "sculpted" the figures in the pediment.

The program opened with slides: each panelist whipped through a set of wonders that ranged from the Piazza Italia in New Orleans, designed by Charles Moore, and the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza fantasy in concrete, "Five Arcades," by panelist Ned Smyth, to Miriam Schapiro's collages-of-kimono shown side by side with the antique kimonos that inspired them. (Schapiro noted later that artists have always used resources-"their studios are filled with reference materials"-but in the recent past have been skittish about owning up to it.)

I say the artists "whipped through" their slides because with eight speakers one might have expected the show to drag a bit, as it can when hungry artists bask too long in the spotlight. But, perhaps bullied by their leaders, or perhaps because each of them has had considerable recognition already, the panelists proceeded smartly, even a bit too smartly. I would have liked a little lingering-to ply the secrets of Miriam's intense kimonos, for instance, or the underglaze magic of Joyce Kozloff's tile wall constructions.

Scott Burton, an anomaly in this context, earned his place with a concise review of aspects of the history of furniture as decoration, and earned forever a place in my heart by describing the pink, light blue, and yellow painted on sections of his child's furniture as "babied-out" versions of the primaries.

Discussion after the slides was desultory, picking up only mildly when one would-be Young Turk declared from the floor that decoration lacks "confrontation." (His own work is, he allowed, based on the sundial.) Joyce ended this confrontation by sweetly but firmly explaining that their premise is decoration for its own sake. The absence of further confrontation may have been due to current general acceptance-even ascendance-of the art. In fact, pattern painting, a major form of the new decoration, has recently been declared by the popular press to be not only "the rage of Europe," but "the most vital" current style!

In the audience were other non-confronters, including Mimi Weisbord, who has survived a move to Soho and gotten a CAPS grant for her book; Yale Epstein, who established a WAN first by liking his picture with the WAN writeup of his panel; Judith Solodkin, now of new large Solo Press premises at 461 Park Ave. South; a phalanx of Heresies women, particularly from the Women's Traditional Arts issue on which both Schapiro and Kozloff worked; a flock of regulars; ghosts of panels past; and probably just plain decoration groupies like myself-some of whom may also have been at the first ATOA panel on pattern painting moderated by Peter Frank at the Open Mind on Greene Street, Feb. 7, 1975 (perhaps the first "public" appearance of the topic up from the underground, one month after Greenberg's certainty).

When they dipped the gallery lights, then threatened to eject us forcibly, small companies began to peel off in search of bars to continue the reunion. But when set upon by jukeboxes, strolling minstrels, or other anti-conversation devices of management, I cede the field immediately. I mean I went right home.

Note: The next ATOA panel, Feb. 2, was "Sources of Patterning and Decoration," with Carrie Rickey, moderator, and Brad Davis, Richard Kalina, Robin Lehrer, Tony Robbin, and Barbara Zucker, speakers.

In "When is a Panel Not a Panel?" (Jan. WAN) Donna Marxer reported on the Nov. 18 panel on communication between artists and writers on art. Carol Duncan: "Criticism is... the invisible power that converts potential art into the real thing... channels art into a thin trickle, which works pretty well." Marxer: "No one groaned... when [Duncan] said flatly that there is no conspiracy in the art world." Here, Duncan elaborates on her intended meaning.

Marxer quoted correctly from the paper I read but didn't quite get my meaning. I did say that there is no "conspiracy" in the art market. As I then tried to explain, I meant that few people in the art world will admit to being party to any art market conspiracy. Even "important" trend-setting dealers and critics can claim that they are exercising their individual free choice and basing their decisions on judgments of "quality." They really believe that and do not experience themselves as acting in some kind of conspiracy. My point is, the "conspiracy" is usually not conscious. It has its roots in the social relations of our society and in the seemingly innocent values we internalize and act upon. The conditions that so many artists find oppressive are reinforced by the aspirations and beliefs of the artists themselves. It is useless to get angry at critics, who are not as powerful as artists imagine. We must understand how our own values and beliefs about art contribute to our own oppression.

In the Nov. WAN... a CETA artist wrote to correct an error of fact in your Summer 1978 article "CETA Artists at Work." She was not on welfare, as had been stated, but on unemployment insurance "the latter [as opposed to welfare] having been earned." Contained within her correction and statement are some hidden value judgments, which should be addressed.

Since public assistance, or welfare, is paid out of monies collected in federal and state taxes, we have all earned our right to receive it when it is necessary. People requiring this assistance, be it in the form of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Supplemental Security Income for the Disabled, Blind, and the Elderly, or Home Relief, have "earned" it just as much as the citizen who receives various forms of subsidies, tax credits, and tax deductions.

"The worthy poor" vs. the "unworthy poor" is a distinction we must transcend. The CETA program accepts job-seeking artists, be they on unemployment insurance or other forms of public assistance.

'Marxist Approaches to Art History'
Panel, Caucus for Marxism & Art, Feb. 1
Eunice Lipton, Carol Duncan, moderators; David Kunzle, Ken Lawrence, Gary Tartakov, Josephine Gear, Adrian Rifkin, speakers.

It's no news that art history is generally taught in a context apart from, or above, history-as though artists, by the nature of their work, have no social responsibility. At this year's CAA convention, the Caucus for Marxism and Art presented an alternative to this general situation and to the convention itself with the panel "Marxist Approaches to Art History."

Eunice Lipton, opening the session, noted the presence of three British speakers out of the five panelists. The first three papers dealt with the connection of art to imperialism; the other two were specific subjects seen from a Marxist perspective.

David Kunzle discussed the role of art in Chile during the Allende regime and under the current military dictatorship, seeing art as a part of, not a response to, social change. At first, he said, murals and posters avoided confrontation with the enemy, later grew less passive. Since the coup in '73 and the concurrent attempts at destruction of popular, political art, new forms of underground art have appeared. For example, arpilleras, fabric wall hangings made by Chilean women. Like the quilts of early American women, they involve individual origin and collective production. Many of the arpilleras contain explicitly political messages; some are less overt and some are simply beautiful. (Both slides and actual examples were shown.) Women are able to earn money through the sale of this work, frequently supporting families splintered by the junta. Pinochet's government finds this and other art with a similar perspective threatening, and has tried, unsuccessfully, to co-opt the arpillera movement.

Ken Lawrence provided a refreshing break from the recent deluge of Tut-dom. Showing how the African-ness, the Egyptian-ness of the Boy King has been distorted, the conflicts of that period of history de-emphasized, Lawrence discussed the way art is used by imperialism because it's "not political."

Gary Tartakov defined exotica as what is "incomprehensible and irrational to us." The title of his talk was "Exoticism and the Imperialist Vision of 19th-Century European Photography of India." Showing some of these photographs in slides, he demonstrated the way that subjects viewed out of context can give an entirely false view of a country and its people. For example, the familiar image of a man lying on a bed of nails conjures up visions of asceticism, pain, and strangeness. Actually, this is a painless, safe religious act done for money by the very poor-at the bottom of the photo, generally cropped, is the receptacle into which to throw coins.

Josephine Gear's topic was "The Cult of the Baby in 19th-Century Art." Using extraordinary slides of British art, all containing two figures (mother and child), she spoke about baby worship and its relationship to the conditions of the time. The creation of nuclear families brought about upheavals in male-female relationships amounting to "the husband producing labor, the wife producing love." Along with this came an idealization of motherhood and, as a result, of babies. The repressed sexuality of the time was also expressed in the strong eroticism of some of the work (this relationship apparently having been the only acceptable place for women's sexuality). Other paintings reflected moods ranging from adulation to fun. In this context, the discussion of women's rights in England became especially meaningful.

Adrian Rifkin, speaking about the cultural context of the Paris Commune, showed another collection of beautiful slides. Most of these were of cartoons demonstrating the formation of class alliances within the political struggle. The degree of physical violence depicted in these cartoons-on both sides-was high. The women's movement was seen as the most socialist of the left at that time.

In the question-and-answer period, there was some discussion about the Caucus and its work within the CAA. In a brief exchange, Carol Duncan politely refused to agree with CAA representative Beatrice Farwell that the CAA is a democratic organization. Gary Tartakov characterized the difference in objectives as "kings and queens, not Queens and Bronx."

'Artists and Community in the Context of Social Change'
Panel, Caucus for Marxism & Art, Feb. 2
Martha Rosler, Alan Sekula, moderators; Mel Rosenthal, Suzanne Lacey, Fred Lonidier, speakers.

The second meeting of the Caucus for Marxism and Art at the CAA convention was a step out of art history and into making art today-specifically, making art that effects social change. Because the Caucus had been granted a very brief time slot, only three artists were scheduled to speak, each to discuss her/his work in the context of social change.

Martha Rosler, in her introduction, noted that each artist was dealing with violence: physical violence or social violence. Later, she tied this to the responsibility of political artists to gain control of language, to move away from the media definition of "violence."

Photographer Mel Rosenthal described his discomfort with audiences that skim over the political content of his photographs, responding only to the form of the work. In his photographs of the South Bronx, Rosenthal has insisted not only on the political meaning of the subject, but on the relationship between the art and the subject-the people of the area. His original idea was to make portraits of everyone living on the street where he works at a health center. It became apparent that many of these people had never seen accurate photos of themselves; in the course of a year, Rosenthal became very involved with them through his work. The photographs show the subjects as very real people-in very real poverty-not just another burned-out-South-Bronx photo in the media.

Suzanne Lacey presented much of the material she'd covered in a previous panel on performance and environmental art from a somewhat different perspective. She and Leslie Labowitz co-founded Ariadne to work against violence against women. Discussing several projects on rape, murder, and violence in the record industry, Lacey explained her use of the media. This entails not only getting the personal cooperation of local government officials and journalists, but actually setting up performances and exhibits to accommodate the media. Underlying this is Ariadne's analysis of the role played by media in preventing or allowing political change.

Fred Lonidier spoke about reaching a labor-union audience. Believing that the whole structure of the workplace must be changed to affect occupational health problems in a major way, Lonidier created a photo exhibit. He took photographs of the results of work-caused diseases and added a text about the historical context of these diseases and injuries within the work situation. The exhibit did attract many union members. At the panel, he spoke of the difficulties of reaching such "non-art" audiences.

When our time in the Lincoln Room ran out (we were reminded of this by another CAA rep), we were left hanging in mid-discussion. Then it was discovered that another spot was, unofficially, available. Perhaps 40 of us sat in a circle there and continued to talk and talk about the role the media play for the political artist, about the difference between (performance) art and political activism (is Phyllis Schlafly a performance artist?), about political art as a process of self-identification (for example, the exhibit of shopping-bag ladies' art at the Met, organized by Anne Marie Rousseau), about definitions of "cultural worker."

TITLE: An Evening with Paula Modersohn-Becker
WRITER: Jennifer Arndt
PAGE_NUMBERS: 9
VOLUME: 4
ISSUE: 9
SEASON_YEAR: March 1979
TYPE: ARTICLE
CONTENT:
AIR Monday Night Programs since 1973 have ranged from male critics discussing women's art to a Heresies open meeting. The biggest audience of the year-more than 50 people-turned up November 20 to hear art historian Diane Radycki read from her recently completed Letters of Paula Modersohn-Becker. The volume includes translations from the German of selected letters and journal entries by Becker, plus chapter introductions and annotations supplying the artistic and feminist contexts of the period.

To date Paula Becker (1876-1907), a painter long acclaimed in Europe, has been virtually unknown in this country. But there has recently been an awakening of interest about her life, work, and times.

Becker, like her husband, Otto Modersohn, was a member of the Worpswede artists' colony, near Bremen, Germany. A 15-minute color film opening the reading gave an idea of the village and the surrounding moors as they were at the turn of the century, as well as a survey of Becker's art. (The movie was rented for the evening by AIR; artist Cathey Billian provided the projector.)

During October and November, Becker's work was being shown at La Boetie Gallery, in an exhibition entitled "Three German Artists' Colonies: 1890-1914: Worpswede, Moritzburg, Murnau." Had she lived longer, Becker might not be remembered as a Worpswede artist, for from the start her work differed radically from that of the colony's other artists.

The new interest in Becker, it seems, is in her person and experience as well as her art. Adrienne Rich's recent book, The Dream of a Common Language, contains a poem, "Letter from Paula Becker to Clara Westhoff" (Becker's closest friend, a sculptor and wife of Rainer Maria Rilke). This "letter" from one woman artist to another explores issues and feelings, gathered from Becker's writings, that are stunningly moving and contemporary.

In 1906, Becker left Worpswede and her husband and stepdaughter to paint in Paris; Radycki's reading focused on this year in France.

"I couldn't stand it any longer and I'll probably never be able to stand it again, either. It was all too confining for me and not what-and always less of what-I needed."

Radycki writes: "It was marriage and the provincialism of Worpswede; . . . it was not being taken seriously by anyone but a dear man whose art took no risks; . . . it was outgrowing heavy skies and artistic moralism; it was turning 30; it was frustration and it was ambition."

Among the all-too-familiar, recurrent themes-financial problems, familial pressure-there emerges a picture of this young artist, her conflicts, her defiance of guilt, and her passion: "I'm getting there. I'm working tremendously...I am going to be something-I'm living the most intensely happy period of my life. Pray for me. Send me 60 francs for models' fees. Thanks. Never lose faith in me."

But as the year went on, the pressure from husband, family, and friends mounted, until in November 1906, Becker allowed her husband to visit her in Paris.

"By March she was pregnant, by May they were back in Worpswede, in November she was dead."

Radycki ended her. reading with "Letter from Paula Becker to Clara Westhoff," Rich herself being unable to attend. During a question-and-answer period, Helen Serger from La Boetie Gallery spoke from the floor about Becker's surviving family. Interest was high and discussion continued informally.

The impact of the evening on many could be summed up in the words of sculptor Erica Rothenberg:

"I had never heard of this artist. I walked into the reading one woman and I'm walking out another. To hear elucidated so vividly and passionately so much of her identity, so many of her struggles... gave me a sense of history and tradition, the knowledge that the things I face today, someone faced 70 years ago. These were the struggles of an artist of genius."

Plain and Fancy: (American Women and Their Needlework, 1700-1850). Susan Burrows Swan. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977. 42 color photos, 123 b&w photos. $14.95 (cloth).

Plain and Fancy is a very important book. It's an intelligent and informative piece of needlework history as well as a source of women's history, weaving the threads of needlework with the course of history. We have all read about Elizabeth (Betsy) Ross and Martha Washington and their needlework; we've also seen a lot about costume and fashion history. But Swan is concerned with wider events. She traces the development of needlework from 1700 to 1850, as well as the lifestyles and social and economic and political pressures on women during these times. The reader realizes that needleworkers have never created in isolation, but have always been formed by the outside world.

The book begins with a description of the difficult lives of our foremothers, their lack of materials, their confined lifestyles. We see the indenture form filed for Sarah Wade in 1826, a contract that forced her to work for a family in exchange for certain "education" and a hope chest of sorts. While the woman was assigned to the home, to spinning, darning, marking linens, cleaning, cooking, and raising children, the men ventured out to pursue business affairs. Women in isolated areas created their own art forms from this isolation, such as the Deerfield embroideries.

During the 18th century, samplers were very popular. In the many boarding schools opened to accommodate young girls, little was taught about "intellectual subjects," but needlework, music, and art were emphasized. In this, Swan points out, the girls were taught to be docile and demure. They were being prepared not to be independent and self-supporting, but to be charming and dainty. At the same time, they were prepared for the poor health and widespread diseases of the times. Most sampler verses are very depressing. In time, schools changed (thanks to some independent-minded women) and eventually needlework disappeared from the curriculum.

In Chapter 3, "The Golden Years of Needlework," Swan paints a wonderful portrait of life in the home. It becomes clear why furniture was so important, why women worked so hard to embroider chair covers and bed curtains. The home was the center of all entertaining. A discussion of the early feminist movement includes the first women's rights convention in 1848 at Seneca Falls, and stories of Mary Wollstonecraft and other women who fought for the right to be independent after their husbands died. (At the time, Swan explains, married women were permitted by law to own virtually nothing.) The reader sees the effects of the Industrial Revolution on needleworkers, the effects of new leisure time and of better education for women.

I loved every minute of Plain and Fancy. I recommend it to needleworkers, feminists, and the male chauvinist who lives down the block.

Alice Neel and Judith Stein spoke at the January 21 meeting of the New York chapter of the Women's Caucus for Art, an evening in the chapter's ongoing program series. More than 50 members came to Wendy Meng's studio for the discussion, which focused on Philadelphia's Moore College of Art, the first women's art school in the United States.

Art historian Stein's research into the history of the college, established in 1848 as the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, brought to light 19th-century attitudes toward art and the female sex. Since women, considered especially well suited for painstaking work, could practice the arts at home, their work as designers would neither conflict with domestic tasks nor bring them into open competition with men. Neither would it expose them (heaven forbid) to sexual temptations through contact with males on the job. In fairness, Stein pointed out, the founders genuinely desired to provide needy women with professional training, and also believed that exposure to art would improve character.

It was the energetic, compassionate Sarah Peter who initiated the effort to found a school of industrial art. Early students practiced drawing, textile design, lithography. wood engraving, and other practical subjects. By 1921, when Alice Neel enrolled as an illustration student, the school's name had been changed and fine arts added to the curriculum. Neel, the school's most famous alumna. confessed that she chose a woman's college in part to be able to concentrate on her work without male distraction. Her lively and witty reminiscences were interspersed with serious advice to young artists ("Train your memory!").

The problem was, scarcely any art students were present at the meeting. A discussion of the discrimination that many women students still encounter would have given perspective to the historical background of women's art education. For example, consider the devastating account by Patt Likos (Feminist Art Journal, Fall 1975) of the pressures she experienced as a student at Moore College.

We need to research women's history in art, to honor and learn from venerable women artists. But we must encourage today's students to speak out and we must heed their testimony if art education is to contribute to equality of opportunity for all artists.

WCA-NY invites the participation of art students. Information from Kathy Schnapper, 242-1941.

Another letter from Jeanette Feldman continues the story begun in last month's WAN She writes here about recognition, choosing between art and crafts, moving on in her work, coming to terms with Texas...

July 18, 1978

I'm glad you liked the material. I was afraid you might be expecting something heavier, about WOMEN struggling together against the art establishment, issuing manifestos right and left-instead of our very simple, selfish reasons for organizing....

In answer to your question, the "Chisos" piece is one of 12 fiber works based on a three-day trip we took several years ago. We began at Big Bend Park in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwest Texas; the Chisos mountains and Basin are in this unique, wild, eroded area. Then we traveled from Presidio (the asshole of Texas and always the hottest spot in this terribly hot state) to Mexico. The train started at 4 p.m. and went through the desert as the sun was setting. I was mesmerized by the shadows in the buttes and the purplish, grey and brown landscape. The next morning we took a train through the Sierras (shades of John Huston and Humphrey Bogart) across Mexico to Los Mochis; then a train home. The object of the trip was the trip. Indian culture, Spanish culture, and the power of nature just exploded in my head. I began working with shapes from the desert and Indian and Mayan-Aztec forms infiltrated...

The flag variations are patchwork with machine and hand stitchery and applique, all in regular home sewing fabrics, nothing fancy or unique. "Hope" has stars and letters in silver stretch dress fabric. I can't afford fancy fabrics and I like the challenge of modifying materials to suit my needs. For instance, I used semi-sheer fabric with dark machine stitching over a different color cloth to get just the exact red I needed-a fiber "glaze" like glazing in oils. Some of the flags are in Regina Bartley's book on machine stitchery.

... I showed the flags in October '76 at Mind's Eye, a gallery in the Montrose area here, which shows craft media as well as "fine" arts. But I've always minded the craft category for myself. The search for mastery of technique and material is all very well and important, but I missed the involvement with currents of contemporary art-making. Finally I withdrew from local craft groups and the American Crafts Council, and resumed painting and drawing along with the fiber work-a felicitous decision.

I had started in fibers ten years ago, beginning with traditional crewel stitches. Gradually I got into all aspects of fiber (except weaving-warping the loom was my Waterloo) and every possible technique-stitching over dye-painted areas, beading, applique (my favorite), patchwork, working in fabric with beads, sequins, and wonderful threads was a sensuous delight. I made all kinds of feelies with fur and feathers, suede and lace. Then I felt I'd mastered the medium-fiber became another technique, not the only one. I added drawing and painting again, and a kind of funky wood sculpture and surrealism...

Your last question is the hardest-about my life today. I'm 48 years old and as an artist always just beginning, starting again. Every new piece seems to be the first-a new learning process. I had assumed these would be my harvest years, instead of always seeding the ground...

I'm still married to Norm, 23 years, and still like him. Ann, 15, and Henry, almost 19, are growing... I wanted it all: art, husband, home, children. I wasn't going to "give up" anything when I married and I have not. I haven't singlemindedly pursued recognition, but I have kept painting...

As for living in Houston, and the somewhat traumatic removal from the northeast-I like Houston, a lot! It's different: the trees are different, shrimp plant grows out-of-doors, the sky is fantastic. When I walk down the street and see date palms and agave and cactus, I get a terrific zing. I find the whole crazy, fierce Texas society exuberant and expansive. A lot of people here have Indian grandparents-I like the Mexican and Indian and cowboy flavor. . . (We'd been living in rural New Jersey, near exit 5 of the Turnpike, and believe me, when you talk about nothing, you are talking about South Jersey.) Houston is not New York, but there's great potential and economic opportunity for my kids, too.

As for art, though, it's a hard go here. There aren't many galleries and two recently closed. The most successful ones show established New York and California artists and well-known Texans. The Museum of Fine Arts is a good institution, but does not involve itself in local art. The Contemporary Arts Museum tries, but has had all kinds of mad, incredible management problems. Local artists seem timid about alternative spaces. (New York artists are much more aggressive, right?) Many of them feel almost invisible if they aren't affiliated with a gallery, but from what I hear, when they do get into a gallery, their troubles may just be starting.

I entered the Milliken Rug Competition in January '78 (found it in WAN) and just got a certificate of merit from them, a gorgeous big thing with a gold seal and all kinds of calligraphy... I've been in a good many juried local, regional, and national shows and have some work in books about fiber art...

So I continue just working. I figure things will develop for me and for the arts in general in Houston ...

I really enjoyed writing this letter.
Regards,
Jeanette

Post Script: A recent note from Jeanette says she's "doing a wild and crazy series of drawings based on the Statue of LIBerty-and dinosaurs. When my son was eight, he thought there were dinosaurs in Texas... Now, older and wiser (both of us), I'm doing drawings of dinosaurs in Texas. And still getting to know the city-the people and the sub-currents-fascinating."

Copy Art. Patrick Firpo, Lester Alexander, and Claudia Katayanagi; opening text by Steve Ditlea. NY: Richard Marek, 1978. $7.95, paper.

What possessed the makers of this marvelous book to wrap it in the world's tackiest cover beats me. Maybe it was the publisher's bright idea to be "commercial." The blurb. says, "Turn your local copier into a personal arts and crafts center," and "Here at last is an introduction to today's hottest new art medium." There are three grammatical errors in the preface, and the first section opens with these unctuous, inane lines: "Welcome to the age of Copy Art. Now anyone has the potential to be an artist or designer at the push of a button."

So what you do is go directly to page eight, there to cast your eyes on "Glove Mudra" by Les Levine and his penetrating statement:

In order to use copying machines to make art, three things are absolutely necessary. The first is crazy wisdom. The second is fearless compassion and the third is a magic dagger which should be plunged into the brain one second before the button on the copying machine is pressed. If all these three rules are adhered to, a perfect work of art will result.

It seems that the authors of Copy Art disagreed among themselves about how to describe the background and contribution of each, so they left that part out-there is no biography or crumb of information about Patrick Firpo, Lester Alexander, Claudia Katayanagi, or Steve Ditlea; we don't even learn what city, or for that matter, country. they live in. One feels the lack. Still, the book belongs in the library of anyone interested in copying, printing, photography, animation, limited editions, crafts-indeed, of anyone interested in the art of the 20th century. It is the smashing catalog for a show we haven't quite had yet-but maybe some heads-up curator will get the idea.

After the salvo from Levine, the opening sections give a rundown on the state of the art and its history and practitioners, beginning with Sonia Landy Sheridan, who initiated the first copier course at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970. (Today the Generative Systems Department at the Art Institute offers a master's degree.)

Sheridan says, "We live in an era when art and science are coming together after having been split since the Renaissance. Da Vinci would have had no problem with using a copier for art."

We read that the 3M Color-In-Color machine (developed in part with Sheridan as artist-in-residence) was "truly interactive, allowing its operator to alter color relationships, values, and density at will." It was driven off the market in 1975 by Xerox Model 6500, which gives color "muddy by comparison," but at one third less cost.

There's human drama, too. It took Chester F. Carlson three years to create the dry-copy process, then nine more to make a penny on it. In the interval it cost him "his marriage, his health, and just, about every spare cent he earned at his job as a patent attorney." (Not to worry; he did eventually become a multi-millionaire.)

Then a "Quick Guide to Copy Processes" explains the salient features of electrostatic transfer and electrostatic direct processes, plus thermographic and photo-chemical non-silver processes, with diagrams.

But the heart and joy of the book is the "Copy Art Art Section" with reproductions of work by some 50 artists, a few words on how each was made, and a statement from the artist. You may not fully grasp Thomas Norton's use of a 3-M color copier in a system designed by Dr. Robert D. Solomon of Solotest Corp., in which a black-and-white video camera picks up an image on a TV screen and introduces it to a copier, which transfers it to paper, adding colors in a process that takes up to 10 minutes; but the next image is Peter Thompson's "Phases," a plant "simply laid on the copier template." (The image after that, though, is Thompson's "Print #13.9 from Unit 13," about which I could understand only that it is made on a 3-M Remote Facsimile Telecopier.)

Johanna Vanderbeek, Kasoundra, Sari Dienes, Sonia Landy Sheridan, Kris Krohn, William Gray Harris, Larry Rivers-famous or unknown, the artists have seduced, coaxed, or bullied their machines into dazzling performances, from five-cents-plain (but elegant) black and white to melting color, collaged, matrixed, mounted, or alone.

The statements, except for the inevitable pompous or lackluster remark, are another education. Harris informs us that "When printed with care and regard to the sensitive technicalities... a 3M color copy has all the qualities of a Fine Art Print." Margot Lovejoy says, "Since the color dyes of the machine are covered with polymer and are permanent, if the work is printed on rag support paper, the resulting print is of archival quality." From Charlton Burch: "I believe that the copying machine is perhaps the greatest reproduction and image-making tool of the 20th century." Patricia Abbot says wryly, "The copy machine may have created a new breed of gambler-the color copier junkie, unable to stop 'playing it' until it spits out that perfect print." (I must add here that the book has no index or list of the artists, which is outrageous and unforgivable. Even as a casual "cookbook" kind of affair it should have had an index.)

The last section of the book, "Copy Crafts," gives a page or so to each of 30 processes, from heat transfers (yes, tee-shirts) and mail art (like postcards) to animation, masks, and "The Home Press." Under "Tiles" we find Charlotte Brown's drawings or parts of paintings that have been run through a 3M machine onto heat transfer material, then ironed onto a standard unglazed H&R Johnson Company tile. And for those with access to one, the Telecopier (3M Remote Facsimile Machine) boggles the mind with its possibilities.

Imagine: "If you transmit an image at four minutes and receive it in six minutes, the image will be compressed... Several people have experimented with using synthesizers to modulate Telecopier sounds and therefore image patterns."

Imagine.

Ann Sutherland Harris said, "These are artists we admire... Awards are not carrots, but represent the values of our society. . . Thank goodness women live a long time and we won't run out of women to give awards to... No woman gets sufficient recognition... It's still difficult to find good books and good reproductions of the work of even these famous women."

Eleanor Tufts said: "If I were a painter, I'd paint like Isabel Bishop."

Isabel Bishop told a story about Jose De Creeft, who, awarded a medal, said "Thank you" and sat down. Pressed to say more, he smiled brilliantly at the audience and said, "Work! Work!"

Selma Burke said, "Thank God for this day." She also thanked the WCA: "The day would never have come without them." And again, "Work is the answer..

Ann Sutherland Harris, introducing Alice Neel, said that in 50 years of painting, Neel has "created a visual record of New York and its people." Her portraits are "profoundly democratic." Alice Neel said her father told her, "I don't know what you'll do-you're only a woman."

Louise Nevelson said the day was important, "not only for American women, but for women all over the world... We've had gods long enough." Also, "I did build an empire, and I think it fits me like a glove."

Ruth Weisberg read a telegram of thanks from Georgia O'Keeffe and said, "She speaks with the flower, bone, and rock... our shared inspiration."

Mary Ann Tighe said WCA is "one of the best examples of work by women." During five years of asking, "Where are the women artists?" it became a catalyst in national affairs. Tighe said also that the political activism of women was a factor in her own appointment to the position she holds at NEA.

Now the NEA is setting up a "sex-blind application review" system, using applicants first initials instead of first names. Although there is bound to be "some recognition" of well-known surnames, she said, "90 percent of applications are from people whose names are not known."

WCA Panel, Jan. 30, Washington, DC
Judith Stein, Univ. of Pa., mod.; Betty MacDowell, Mich. State Univ. ("The Legacy of the Lady Limners: Folk Portraiture by American Women"), Rachel Maines, Center for the History of American Needlework, Pittsburgh ("The Designer and Artisan: The Ancient Contract"), Pat Ferraro, San Francisco State Univ. ("Quilts in our Lives"), Miriam Schapiro, Amherst College, and Melissa Meyer, NYC ("Femmage," Heresies).

The first WCA panel program, "Folk Art and Neo-Folk Art," was both exhilarating and illuminating. Panelists touched on important points of original research, while much of the territory explored was new. Well-chosen slides introduced the work of unknown women past and present and relevant pieces by well-known contemporaries. A cloud of doubt may still linger as to where and when folk art and naivete give way to professionalism, however. MacDowell and Maines asserted that training is the key, but Ferraro, Schapiro, and Meyer freely interspersed untrained artists' work with that of others, without identification. One was left to make one's own deductions.

In her introduction, moderator Stein said that Folk Art as a subject was "discovered" in the 1920s and that the topic was a first for both CAA and WCA. She suggested that this might be because art historians have trouble dealing with Folk Art as art. Now feminism makes us aware that women have long studied, collected, and documented (primarily for themselves and their families) artifacts and objects of folk art by other women. In a sense, then, art history has been a means of social control. Then again, much of this art is made with relatively cheap materials and/or discards, and it is possible that art historians really had difficulty understanding and appraising it. Now there appears to be a growing revolution in taste allowing us to begin, at last, to evaluate and document.

Betty MacDowell, author of a new book, Artists and Aprons, pointed out that 18th-and 19th-century women's folk art was shaped by American culture. Rigid roles in marriage and parenthood meant that women's lives were filled with domestic responsibility. Their education stressed needlework, penmanship, and watercolor along with the "social graces." Fine arts as a field was discouraged, for women were not to study the live nude male model! Women channeled their creativity into the domestic scene; portraiture was a natural exploration-familiar and available faces of family and friends could be done quickly in pastels or watercolors, between chores. Women took the scissors of domesticity to cut paper profiles, also. MacDowell said repeatedly that the art had to fit around the accepted patterns of a woman's life; it rarely even approached a full-time activity.

By the mid-1800s, demand for portraits by self-taught artists lessened, due to the advent of the camera. People preferred the likeness of photography to record friends and family. The disappearance of the naive artist began.

Rachel Maines traced the professional relationship between designer and artisan. While the individual artist has been important since the Renaissance, little has been written about the division of labor between the creator of an idea and the maker-constructor, a division that may in Europe and America be made according to class and sex. The designer has always reigned over the technician. Mechanization of textiles reduced the artisan's role to mere machine-tender (and began the producer-consumer division). The designer-artisan contract was originally intended to resolve technical problems encountered in the initial design stage.

In early history, embroiderers tended to be at a higher level socially. The designer was part of the staff in wealthy households, and full-time employment included not only designing the intricate details of clothing, but also devising patterns for linens, curtains, rugs, and furniture. Folk embroidery, however, was produced from designs without direct contact between artist and designer. Folk artisans borrowed motifs freely from many diverse traditions and sources and tended to combine them. Samplers were the work of students learning stitchery and thus held even more incongruities.

The earliest commercial needlework used charts for needlepoint and was done in quadrants. At first the designs were hand-painted; later they were printed. Thread and yarn manufacturers discovered the advantage of professional designs, hiring women to draft patterns derived from popular magazines and pamphlets. After 1870, charts were available for beadwork, filet lace and crochet, and counted cross-stitch.

In the late 1960s, a change began. Now needleworkers and textile artisans often want concept and design wed together, although some do still favor the designer-artisan division.

Pat Ferrero traced the life transitions of women folk artists through their quilts. Baby quilts could be utilitarian or elaborate or both at the same time. Quilting skills were passed from generation to generation, older women teaching young children. The engagement party was often the occasion for quilting, while the "masterpiece" was usually the wedding quilt-carefully conceived and painstakingly rendered during the engagement.

The widow's quilt drew on a rich store of memories. Ferrero showed a quilt made from a Victorian mourning coat, which had been opened up to become a ground for both quilting and embroidery. A coffin in the center was surrounded by vignettes of the quilter's life.

Grace Earl, a transplanted Chicagoan now working in San Francisco, was seen in several slides with an incredible array of patterned fabrics of every description, which, sitting in her crowded one-room apartment, she pieces into intricate coverlets of exquisite skill and conception. (Ferrero has also made a film on Earl.)

Mimi Schapiro and Melissa Meyer developed their thesis of "femmage," and also had a document on the subject, which they handed out to the audience. This included their definitions of collage, assemblage, decoupage, and photomontage as background for their jointly coined phrase, "femmage." The basic premise here is that "leftovers" are essential to a woman's experience. Schapiro pointed out that most of the classic written works on collage refer to male artists. Therefore, she and Meyer developed "femmage" to mean the same form made solely by women.

Meyer and Schapiro listed several criteria for "femmage," but were careful to state that not every one need appear in each object. But for the work to be "appreciated" as "femmage" at least half of the criteria must be met. These include: being made by a woman, recycling of scraps, saving and collecting, themes relating to the life context, covert imagery, diaristic nature, celebration of private or public events, expectation of an intimate audience, drawing or handwriting "sewn" in, silhouetted images fixed on other material, inclusion of photographs or printed matter, recognizable images in narrative sequence, abstract pattern elements, and the possibility of a functional as well as an aesthetic life for the work.
