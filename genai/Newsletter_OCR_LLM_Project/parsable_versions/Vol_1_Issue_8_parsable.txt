TITLE: GENDER IN ART AN ONGOING DIALOGUE

TYPE: PANEL
CONTENT:
A group of women artists decided to express their growing disenchantment with the women's movement. "Gender in Art An Ongoing Dialogue," was a title just vague enough to attract a large turnout of artists at the AIR gallery. Following a brief slide presentation, moderator/artist Nancy Spero set the tone with an opening statement full of vague references to a meeting the artists had held several years ago. Spero mentioned neither the topics discussed nor the conclusions formulated, just that they had discussed "a common bond between women."

The panel, in trying to redefine "feminist," "feminine," and "female," were unable to agree, but initially opted for "female." According to artist Rosemary Mayer "a feminist esthetic is a very precise thing; a feminine esthetic is a lousy term; and a female esthetic could possibly have meaning." Before Mayer could elaborate on the "possibility of meaning," artist/anthropologist Elizabeth Weatherford challenged the choice of "female." She preferred "feminist" to describe women artists' work but conceded that "certain stylistic choices are made."

Critic Lucy Lippard said, "If a woman is thinking about her work as by a woman she is probably pre-feminist, post-feminist, or something-or-other-feminist." Artist Nancy Kitchel said, "so little imagery is left to be applied to female, feminine, and feminist art." After using the panel's terms, Kitchel bemoaned the fact that "art has been separated by its terminology out of the stream of human activity" so far as to become a "separate category alien to the artists' intentions."

Spero pointed out that Rosemary Mayer's sculptures were titled with the names of great and powerful women. Yet Mayer claimed her intention was not really feminist. "My work was feminist to the extent that I thought people should be aware of the lives and activity of those women. It was not feminist to the extent that I thought those forms were female," answered Mayer. She elaborated on the stereotypes associated with art done with stitching and fabric. There was no general agreement about the relevance of techniques learned by women growing up and their application to a feminist consciousness in art.

The discussion had little to do with the stated subject. Some of the panelists commented on the male dominance of the art world--a theme which surfaced early, got lost, then re-surfaced in response to sharp audience questioning. The audience expressed feelings of powerlessness in a male dominated society. Artist Joan Semmel answered that women are our audience, that women have a gut response to art, and that her own art came out of a sense of powerlessness (although Semmel no longer feels powerless). Spero strongly disagreed. One could not help get the feeling that we were listening to an economic theory, that many of the women were interested only in the marketing and marketability of feminist art.

The heart of the dilemma seems to be the intrinsic value versus the extrinsic commodity value of art. As to whether there is a specific female art form--a panelist asserted that the traditional female approach has been to reach out, while the male approach has been to look into himself in order to create. This was directly contradicted by statements of at least half a dozen women about their own creativity.

The confusion deepened when someone mentioned that she had been reading a book claiming that people were pushed, because of education, away from the visual toward the verbal. This led to the speculation that female and male spatial perceptions are different--a useful statement, if true, but taken wholly out of context.

The discussion might more appropriately have been titled: "Disgruntled Artists Lower Consciousness." Despite claims of innovation, the ground had been gone over before.

CONTENT:
The impetus for the woman's movement in the art world was blatant discrimination, exclusion and isolation. It was important for many of us in the early years to have the opportunity to see each other's work, and to gain the confidence to further develop and expand our own work. We then returned to our private worlds to work intensively, gradually gaining exposure, first in women's shows, then in wider contexts.

The profusion of women's panels this season is a signal that we are once again seeking nurturance from each other, and that the movement is readying itself for the next stage in its development. Unfortunately many of the panels have failed to deal with the substantive issues and have left us with an aftertaste of frustration and negation.

A panel that calls itself "Gender In Art-An Ongoing Dialogue" and then refuses to deal with content or sources, or gender itself except in terms of careerism, does a disservice to us all.

Because women's work has been discriminated against for years, many women are paranoid about having their art described as distinctively female, feminist, or feminine. Some think women's art should be accepted because it is the same, or as good as, men's. I want it to be accepted because it is different. Therein lie its power and its possibilities.

Has art made by women been excluded from the cultural mainstream simply because of the prevalence of discriminatory practices against women? Or because it also often validates an experience, a female experience, one from which the male world feels excluded? Is it not from this very validation that women's art derives its special authenticity? Is it not time that the female experience became part of the making of our collective history, of our supposedly collective culture, where it may serve to modify some of the anti-humanistic tendencies of that culture?

Do we as women artists consciously seek the sources of our work? Some women are afraid that the seeking of those sources will be ideologically coercive. I disagree. Self-knowledge stimulates self-definition.

If women's art encompasses a wide range of styles, are there similarities in content? What in our relationship to our space, to time, to materials, to our sexual roles, is different from men's and how does this affect our work? Why does so much of women's art deal with sexual motifs, organic form, autobiography, process and craft materials, highly personal and non-hierarchic form? How does this overlap with tendencies in women's writing?

The questions are endless. It is time for an ongoing dialogue.

Bibi Lencek, 41st in the Women Artists Series at Mabel Douglass College Library, showed, thru Nov. 21, paintings of a young couple (modelled by Lencek and companion) in various positions of lovemaking. Done in a cool realistic style, the paintings used such "banal" details as patterned sheets, tissue box, wall plug, and potted plant to give a "sense of place." Ms. Lencek says that although the figures are prominent, she considers them "merely a part of an indoor landscape."

In a letter to Targum, the Rutgers newspaper, Douglass Student Barbara Ambler protested the show. It was, she said, distracting, "undermining the quality of my life" as a Christian. She wished to lead a life "pleasing to God," but sex "in the wrong situation...can destroy us." Another letter from a more worldly student protested the portrait of Alexander in the Alexander Library, because "each time I see it I begin to fantasize about sex."

Although most students seemed neutral or unconcerned, the distress of the minority was so acute that an open forum was held, Nov. 11.

Protestors included Ms. Ambler and other members of the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. Espousing a "Christian Ethic," they objected to public display of work which aroused sexual fantasy. Sex is "a beautiful gift from God," they said, but belongs only within the bonds of "Holy Matrimony." One student read from the Bible of Adam and Eve's recognition of their nakedness and covering themselves, from which he inferred the sinfulness of the naked body. Turning to Ms. Lencek, he said, "The Devil speaks to us in many ways."

A more lenient faculty and administration noted that artists have for centuries depicted male and female nudes in secular and religious paintings, mentioning Titian, Rubens and Ingres. One faculty member observed, "These are not sweaty paintings," noting that no genitalia were portrayed. Reviewer Lynn Bershak said, "Lencek alters the positions of the lovers as one would re-position flowers or fruit in a bowl...lovemaking is a subject for genre painting" like nursing mothers or children at play. Robert Tanksley, Co-ordinator for Religious Affairs, noted that spiritual asceticism is achieved by confrontation and transcendance, not avoidance.

Assistant Professor Gloria Orenstein said that after her trip each day through the New Jersey oil fields, scenes of love were a relief and reminder of good in humanity. Other staff members agreed that the art was a joyous distraction from grim reality, and that painting gas stations was more truly pornographic.

Several students admitted they hadn't really looked at the paintings. Thinking they had learned something about art, they agreed to try again. (One said that although he came to the library often, he hadn't noticed the art until he read about it in the paper.) Lynn Miller, librarian, and director of the series, apologized to those whom the show had offended, but announced it would remain up.

Now in its fifth year, the Women Artists Series began as an informal effort to fly the flag for women artists at a woman's college with primarily male art professors. Artist Joan Snyder had approached Daisy Brightenback, head librarian in 1971, with the idea of using the library walls as an alternative space for showing women's work. Although many women were working, painting and producing at the time, few had opportunities to show. Sympathetic, Brightenback turned the project over to Lynn Miller, then a new librarian eager to make the library exciting. She and Snyder got a little money from the library budget, scrambled for transportation, hitched trailers to Miller's station wagon, rented trucks, got parking tickets, argued with policemen, and working with the artists, put together the early shows.

From the first mimeographed announcement to the present professional catalog, media coverage, impressive roster of participating artists, and, as Ms. Miller says, "everyone in the WORLD sending in slides," has been a long road and a major achievement.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art sent a form letter to galleries (picked up by a WAN correspondant at a Solo Co-op) inviting entries for an American Family show in '76. The letter specified conditions of submission in detail--photos and slides to be returned, Xeroxes not, etc. Taking this at face value, WAN reprinted the information for its readers (Nov.). But the museum was annoyed to receive such entries, even those including return envelope. Tara Glass Robinson, Co-ordinator of Exhibitions, wrote us that this was not an open show, and that it was, in fact, already selected (reported in Dec. WAN).

Please tell us--when is an invitation not an invitation? What is an open show?

ARTISTS TALK ON ART Nov. 21. Louis Finkelstein, Mod.; Rosemarie Beck, Paul Georges, Wolf Kahn, Raoul Middleman, Paul Resika, Panelists.

I loved this panel for its warmth and camaraderie, even or especially for its practiced passions: Resika rhapsodizing on a tear duct; Georges in a funny and fiery attack on the Met, the French show, the academic mind and "naked representation"; Kahn in a confessional mood: Middleman in two hilarious anecdotes on the clues to likeness or how we recognize each other; Beck more reserved and thoughtful; moderator Finkelstein saying affectionately, but probably meaning it, that if Georges were any more successful, he'd be unbearable.

I loved the panel's intimacy with the works which concerned it. Though I knew they'd fought these fights before, I could even empathize with their delight in landing a few blows on the dead horse of abstraction. Lastly, Georges on Leslie's second O'Hara: "I was so happy to see the improvement--he finally got that big foot out. The trouble is, that painting needed a big foot!"

Is it naive to expect a government body, such as the New York State Council on the Arts, to fund a group criticizing it, in this case the Foundation for the Community of Artists?

The grounds originally given by the Council for de-funding the Community were that it and its publication, Art Workers News, are no longer needed. Given the present legal, economic and tax status of artists, that statement is absurd.

Art Workers News can be dull and unfocused, but no more so than a lot of art funded by the Council. AWN investigations of dangers of art materials, workings of art bureaucracies, studies of legislation, and programs of insurance for artists may not make titillating reading, but they benefit all artists. If some of AWN's advocacies have been unrealistic, their reports on applications of art moneys are indeed real, and their protests led the council to establish appeals procedures where none had existed, and, for the first time, to promulgate a set of guidelines.

There should be open guidelines, publicly accounted for--a necessary antidote to bureaucratic whim. For instance: funds should go to projects the private sector can't or doesn't provide, should deliver for artists, not administrators, and be allocated according to a merit system more impersonal than the presently operative one.

One thinks of NYSCA projects that are the cosy fiefdoms of a few and their cronies. The Community of Artists operates in the general interest, as advocates of all artists. It should have the funds to do a proper job.

An International Invitational, curated by Alice Baber. Women's Interart Center, NYC, thru Jan. 30. Excerpts from an interview, Constance Kane with Alice Baber:

KANE: You have the makings of a book as well as a record of works in the exhibition.

BABER: ...Some artists sent in a poem. Others wrote a biographical statement, sent photos of themselves, or works in the show, or other works. There are four volumes on display. Of course the ideal situation would have included more space, more time, and many more countries.

KANE: Current trends are recognizable. For instance, collage elements...in the work of Mimi Schapiro and the sculpture of Eugenie Gershoy. Patterns in Joyce Kozloff's paintings have echoes of the American Indian, as well as quilt-like pattern that recalls Appalachian handiwork....

...Joan Semmel's work has more to do with the current interest in erotic art. Alice Neel has always done her own thing in those penetrating, uncomfortable portraits. She has always held up a taut psychological mirror. But, I can't say that it's particularly female. Perhaps Sylvia Sleigh's interest in subject matter is feminine, but the work itself is not...I think Elise Asher's work has always been crisply feminine, in a very pretty and poetic way--rather like a self-portrait in calligraphy. But many, like Louise Nevelson, Betty Parsons, Ruth Frankin, Hedda Sterne, and Addie Herder simply seem to be doing their own thing and always have.

Did you have trouble getting work from such countries as Turkey, Iran and India?

BABER: Luckily I was able to borrow those from the Grey Gallery at NYU. It was important to show that women all over the world from many diverse backgrounds are working in the arts. Yes, many countries don't allow paintings to be sent out of the country, or, in some cases, to return. Getting work through customs can be a serious problem.

KANE: ... I know how much time a project like this can take. What satisfactions did it give?

BABER: ... Showing some of these artists for the first time in NY was gratifying, especially in international women's year... It was an exciting experience...

Dear Editors,

A propos of Phoebe Hellman's remarks reported in Women Artists Newsletter Nov. 1975: the tampaxes distributed at the Whitney Museum five years ago in the Ad Hoc protests were nice clean ones, marked, as I recall, "50% women" (referring to the Annual), not, in any case, tainted by the "dirt" some well-conditioned people still associate with menstruation!

There have been so many inaccurate accounts of the early days of the women artists' movement that I guess the time has come to start correcting the basic facts, even as minor as this one.

And, incidentally, while my view of what happens at these panels doesn't always coincide with that of your writers, I think it's a terrific idea to cover them so thoroughly. Many thanks.

-- Lucy R. Lippard, New York

Dear Ms.

My entry form for the Marietta Art Show has arrived and I notice it is an all man selection jury--I enclose their aims (see below). I am not entering this show.

-Carolyn Berry, Monterey, CA.

Mainstreams '76 will promote the concept that the qualities in art to which man personally reacts are those that are symbols of man's existence and his involuntary quest for beauty. These qualities bridge all centuries, all art styles, and are, apparently, very close to the essence of man's communication with man. Our purpose is to bring, insofar as possible, the best examples. of painting and sculpture to our college and community.

Sleigh Letter Corrected

WAN has shot its proofreader at dawn. Sylvia Sleigh's letter last month was intended to clarify, not further confuse. A WAN quote, "It's time for a major museum to do a major show of women, not one started and paid for by women," might in the context have been taken to refer to the Women Choose Women show at the NY Cultural Center. In that show, as Sleigh wrote, "The only obligation on exhibiting artists was to deliver their work, and the catalog was funded."

Panel-HUMANIZING THE ART WORLD-12/13 Joellen Bard, Mod; Diane Burko, Richard Karp, Cindy Nemser, Jonathan Price, Jacqueline Skiles, Panelists.

The seemingly well-fed, well-dressed, well-educated "humanists" on this panel about "Humanizing the Art World" are outraged at a system which has allowed them this much, but, to date denied them the fame, wealth or power they see elsewhere.

Their talk mixed truth impartially with nonsense. The salient truth was Jackie Skiles' observation that the moneys going into Art Councils across the land have created thousands of middle class jobs with fringe benefits for arts administrators, but have moved scarcely an artist into the middle class.

On balance, though, the foolishness bothered me more than the truths roused me, and, wincing at the howlers, I began to apply a kind of "Yeah, Like" clause in my mind, as antidote to the effects of blither on my pre-holiday psyche. Here, more or less verbatim, are some of their sillier assertions and my irritated replies:

THEM: It is content that infuses art with vitality.
ME: Yeah, like the painting of the most beautiful object in the world is the most beautiful painting in the world.

THEM: Corporations promote abstract art because aesthetics are safe. Stripes, circles, etc. won't propagate revolutionary ideas.
ME: Yeah, like the Constructivists and Futurists did abstract art to support monarchy.

THEM: The artistic object today often has nothing to do with the world beyond it.
ME: Yeah, like what is art, anyway?

THEM: Artists start with warm and spiritual, rather than pragmatic things.
ME: Yeah, like crucifixions, flagellations, battle scenes and grids.

THEM: Humanism means warmth, tenderness, kindness to neighbors and sharing.
ME: Yeah, like rage and aggression are purely aesthetic.

THEM: What's wrong with being refused [from a co-op]? Rejection is humanistic, too.
ME: Yeah, like "warmth, tenderness, kindness to neighbors and sharing."

If "humanizing the art world" is a code phrase to mean wrenching power from the fallible humans who now possess it, I'm interested, but the pious cant is distracting.

Any extension of human thinking, from Fibonacci to the Pyramids, is "humanistic." Limiting art to "pictures," so-called "explorations of self" and a few other minor genres, curbs art and intellect as much as "inevitable progression" ever did. Who needs a know-nothing backlash in the name of "humanism"?

"Women Look at Women," the work of 30 women photographers from the permanent files of the Library of Congress closed Dec. 31 in Washington. 150 pieces selected from the show, from the 1890's through the present, will tour the country beginning in January.

The exhibitors deserve credit for the vision and patience necessary to sift through the Library's vast collection of Imogen Cunningham, Laura Gilpin, Marion Post Wolcott, Gertrude Käsebier, Toni Frissell, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus and others. But the imposed subtitles--"As Women Alone," "As Modern Women,' " "On the Farm," "As Wives," "As Mothers," etc.--are often distracting and irrelevant. Simple chronology might have better paralleled the changes in the women, their medium and subject matter.

But the show is well worth seeing--for the glory of these important artists grouped together--another reminder of our collective wealth.

A History of Women Artists, by Hugo Munsterberg, N.Y., Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1975; 150 pp., $12.95.

A History of Women Artists by Hugo Munsterberg is a quick read. In 147 pages Munsterberg undertakes a global survey of female artists from Neolithic times to the present, including the so-called crafts and devoting more than half the book to the twentieth century. He is very selective.

Artists are included if their age or posterity has found them significant,' but what Munsterberg himself thinks is not apparent. Rarely has a book, even in the survey genre, displayed so little point of view. Instead of a critical stance, Munsterberg keeps score. Of Rosa Bonheur:

"Certainly the praises heaped upon her during her lifetime were much too extravagant, and there is no doubt that several of her male contemporaries, who were less successful at the time, have emerged as far greater artists. [Also]... she is surpassed by at least two women painters of the period, Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt. However, it may be that as the emphasis upon formal values declines ...the narrative and naturalistic qualities of her work will be again appreciated."

The excerpt is representative, and while this survey of women artists is a sympathetic one (forget his use of 'one-man' show), its scorekeeping is silly and unnecessarily defensive. Joan Mitchell isn't Picasso but neither is De Kooning. Anyway, who cares: we are not buying stocks.

Attempting to rank the sexes would involve, moreover, examining under what conditions art is produced and Munsterberg doesn't do this. Instead, there are capsule summaries of each artist's life and work, including over 100 reproductions of rather poor quality. These summaries, particularly the anecdotal material, make one want to hear more.

One is struck, for example, by how frequently fathers (and husbands) figure in the artists' development and one wonders where the mothers were keeping themselves. We're also curious about the personal history of such artists as Angelica Kauffmann and Lily Martin whose husbands devoted themselves to their wives' careers, or Labille-Guiard's insistence on the right of women to teach art and the speculation about what being raped meant to Artemisia Gentilesche's art.

Whichever figures strike one, there isn't any doubt that much more can be said, and in this connection, it's a pity that Munsterberg did not include a bibliography. He's also evasive about gender descriptions of art, telling us for example that Laurencin's work is usually seen as "feminine, meaning that it is gentle and poetic rather than bold and expressive." And his views about stature and influence can be questioned along with the odd suggestion that "for some reason, women are more gifted verbally than visually." But the book's limits make our questions, or complaints about the omission of (say) American quiltmakers, or Grace Hartigan, beside the point. However, Munsterberg does whet the appetite and his work should encourage others to go further.

"No painting ever seems 'finished, even after many months of work: there is simply a time when she can do no more with it. She tries to express in a painting the unfinished quality of life." So writes Karl Lunde of the work of Isabel Bishop in his introductory essay to the recent volume reproducing paintings, drawings, and etchings. Isabel Bishop has been captivated primarily by one subject --the men and women who live and work in the vicinity of her Union Square studio. She depicts their everyday gestures and momentary, unconscious actions, making us see the monumental in the commonplace and transitory.

This book does justice to Isabel Bishop's work. The reproductions are excellent, the etchings full scale in most cases. Bishop first does studies, then etchings and aquatints, which prepare for the paintings. This process is described with great sensitivity. Isabel Bishop is a truly beautiful book; it gives the feeling of possessing the works of the artist.

"The Nude in Photography," by Arthur Goldsmith. Ridge and Playboy Press, 1975. $19.95

This lap-sized, pseudo-intellectual presentation of the mostly female nude as seen by fine-art and commercial photographers would have fared better as two books.

In the chapter called "Scandalous Beginnings," we are drawn to the strength of Muybridge's still-photo action sequences of the male and female model, to the delicacy and great charm of the French picture postcards, to Bellocq's keen and sympathetic portrayal of a New Orleans prostitute, and to the unique visions of Weston, Lange and Morgan. The Playboy-style pictures done by Look, Life and SatEve Post photographers appeal to other sensibilities. The final chapters are an unhomogeneous mix of commercial, semi-pornographic, fine-art (the primal nudes of D. Niccolini) and experimental work. The text should have been set apart from the pictures--not placed on most of the pages as small bits of chattery prose.

However, if you received 'this book for Christmas, it is fun--if you are a woman, to compare your body with the great variety of nudes here, and, if you are male, to pick and choose and daydream over all the girls.

Art on the Edge - Harold Rosenberg. Macmillan Publishing Company, 1975 $12.95

Rosenberg's tall figure stalking the art world or sitting back, stiff leg out, observing the events to which the professional art watcher must attend--developments of the past fifteen years have forced him to an ironical distance. The ideals, however, of the early years as poet, Marxist and friend of the artist remain the standard against which all else is measured.

Seen from Rosenberg's distance, the busy-ness of the art world takes on a faint Swiftian tint--is silhouetted and flattened. For example: his use of the word, "Moffetters" to refer to those who agree with curator Kenworth Moffett's assessment of Olitski. With this one mild word, Rosenberg dwarfs the actors on the stage; they grow down, quaint and squat, the "preeminence" of Olitski with them.

These "Moffetters" are to be found astride the first segment of Rosenberg's new book, "Art on the Edge," in which 28 essays in three sections called Creators, Reflections and Situations are assembled and directed to a point. The book's title derives from one of the concluding chapters, "On the Edge," in which the Brobdingnagian feats of "Documenta 5" are discussed. In the foreword Rosenberg states: "...this prolific support of art and hyperanimation of the art scene themselves carry the danger of propelling painting and sculpture over the edge that separates them from the crafts, commercial design and the mass media. "

We know that the significance of "Documenta 5" was inflated precisely by the sum of two million dollars but can this be seen as "prolific support of art"--an extravaganza which includes a token few paintings & sculptures under the banner "Art is Superfluous"? If official salons are accurate indexes of the direction art is taking, then art is heading "over the edge."
